B:	Huh.
B:	Well, here in Seattle, uh, it's the air's getting more and more polluted.
B:	We're, uh, we're in kind of a basin
B:	And, uh, Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains.
B:	And, uh, there's been a lot, a lot of growth, population growth around here
B:	And, uh, it's, uh, it's getting worse
B:	I think  most of it is from cars.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Definitely.
A:	Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the, of these Rocky Mountains here, where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo
A:	and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north,
A:	we get a lot of pollution
A:	and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And, uh, it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion
A:	And when we get, get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
A:	and it just sits and sits and sits
A:	and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's not, it's almost sad.
A:	Because when I grew up here, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys
A:	and now it's not in the mountain valleys.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I live in the, university district
B:	and, uh, uh, it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution
B:	I think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school.
A:	Huh.
B:	And then we're right next to Interstate Five also.
A:	They're getting serious about things like, uh, mandatory,
A:	well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties,
A:	emissions.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	have they started doing that yet?
A:	Yeah.
A:	They've actually started doing it down along the,
A:	not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better.
A:	We have a lot, population is a lot lighter up here.
B:	We have that here
B:	and, uh, they're, they're expanding it to, uh, more counties here. Uh, as the population spreads out
B:	and I think they're also going to be making it, uh, mandatory for more cars.
B:	there was, uh, something in the law about if your car was over a certain age, like over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done anymore.
B:	And  I think they're eliminating that, uh  that loophole.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They're eliminating that out here.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun. Where they're, uh, looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the, basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust.
A:	Kind of like a radar gun.
A:	And ...
B:	Oh, really,
B:	You mean they could  do that remotely?
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do it remotely just looking at the, what they do,
A:	they do several different types of things.
A:	Sometimes they put a source light
A:	and they look at the source light
A:	and then as the car goes by, you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it
A:	and you can look at the emissions actually.
B:	Huh.
A:	And ...
B:	Now where does the source light go?
A:	Like across the street.
A:	They'll set up  like a trap or something like that in some sense.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And they're also looking at, uh, other, you know, ways of monitoring this and, cause they've found out something basically that, uh,
A:	and a poorly tuned car can emit something,
A:	it's an incredible amount.
A:	It was like four hundred times as much uh, of certain pollutants, and it was like unburned hydrocarbons, then a properly tuned car.
B:	Jeez.
A:	And, and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars, well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the, the pollution then, you know, you, it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's neat
B:	But it's also been, uh, oh, you know,
B:	everybody is talking about using more mass transient here
B:	but it, uh, it's tough, you know.
B:	Like I've, I've looked into riding the bus to work
B:	and I can drive to work in, uh, and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But if I, uh, if I take the bus, it requires several transfers
B:	and it takes over an hour.
A:	Huh.
B:	So so it  it's, it's not hard to see why, why I keep driving.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they're ...
B:	And you know, I feel guilty cause I'm driving a
A:	Hi
B:	Hi.
A:	Uh, uh I, I should say something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That I'm the, uh, least informed,
A:	this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic.
A:	But, it's, I'm the least informed person in the whole United States.
A:	This has not been determined yet
A:	but I, I, I've never read a newspaper in my entire life
A:	and I've, I, I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off.
A:	But,
B:	Any particular reason?
A:	Well, no.
A:	I, I've, I've explored that with lots of people.
A:	Uh, they've tried to lock me up and, uh, things like that.
A:	But, uh, uh, I'm basically not interested
A:	and I also find the, uh, everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and and off the, uh, uh,
A:	what am I trying to say. Uh,
A:	I do learn about things. Largely from friends
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh
A:	and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS.
A:	You know, someone will write a book about something
A:	and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it,
A:	and somehow,
A:	and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so, uh, covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it.
A:	But, I mean, I don't think it's just that I'm lazy
B:	I really don't,
B:	I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon. Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest. But, assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. Uh, without thinking that there were people in, who think each other areas, area of, of specialty
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I guess you could explain it two ways.
B:	And, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all.
B:	And the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in buying something as a, you know  as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I think the same thing is true with news.
B:	If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on, most papers, and especially the better papers, the, the TIMES, the WALL STREET JOURNAL, the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know  that much.
A:	Right.
A:	Doesn't want,
A:	Let me ask, by the way, just for the record.
A:	I, I'm, I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them.
A:	So, I mean, I'm not being elitist in that sense, I hope. Uh,
B:	Well, I mean, there's, there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things
A:	Yeah.
A:	What,
B:	And most people think it is
B:	and I can, I can, you know, accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	By the way when you say most people think it is,
A:	I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is, percent.
B:	I don't think it's that high.
A:	Oh, you don't?
B:	I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper.
A:	Right.
B:	And I think they're saying well if something's really important, I'll at least find out that it happened.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and that's a, that's, is a reasonable start
B:	and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked.
B:	Uh, and if something important happened, it was covered on T V
B:	and I could then go and, and pick up newspapers if, if it were important enough to read about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I did, on the, uh, the Supreme Court hearings, the, for, uh, uh, the whole business of, uh,
A:	see I actually have a, a,
B:	Clarence Thomas or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	the Thomas and Anita Hill business.
B:	Right.
A:	I, I mean that's, that's the closest thing.
A:	I deeply cared about that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine
A:	and when I arrived at her house, she was engrossed in that.
A:	We ended up watching it for a couple of hours. Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more.
A:	And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on.
A:	But even then, I didn't end up doing it on my own. Uh, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I stayed as far away from those as I could.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I decided I didn't want to waste the time
B:	I had, I guess, five years ago now, wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings. And afterwards, decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in. And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you ever read,
A:	what sort of company do you work for?
A:	Do you work for a big or a little place?
B:	Uh, I work for Georgia Tech.
B:	Yes sir.
B:	I work for the research facility.
B:	Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense
B:	but it, it does have, about, uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small.
B:	It just have a lot of different laboratories.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's make up most of the laboratory
B:	so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about yourself?
A:	Huh.
A:	Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place.
A:	I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	I see.
A:	Uh, and, uh,
A:	so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T.
A:	So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh  the technical institution.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Right. Uh,
A:	Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't know.
A:	What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?
B:	Well those and probably the security aspect of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated,
B:	and it may not be true in every place.
B:	In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in.
B:	How they going to pay their bills.
B:	They just lay them off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh,
B:	I think the company still exists.
B:	What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like,
B:	unemployment is good
B:	but I mean the company as a whole
B:	because you as an employee, even the company is making money,
B:	they paying you a salary
B:	but you are responsible for that company growth.
B:	You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits.
B:	So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know.
B:	I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation.
A:	Now how do you mean that?
A:	I know it,
B:	Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh, for the bad times of the company.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know. In that standpoint.
A:	Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company
A:	or,
B:	yes,
B:	I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really do.
B:	I think it'd be better that way
B:	and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because  they know that that there are problems
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know. That's just, that's my views, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that.
A:	I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile.
A:	They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	And I think you can do that for a little while
A:	but I'm,
B:	Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance
A:	Yeah.
A:	All right, have you lived in this area long?
B:	No,
B:	I've only been here a couple of years.
A:	Okay.
B:	Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain.
A:	I mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well I remember last year, or the year before, uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh,
A:	But it,
B:	terrible ice storm, uh, around this time of the year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny
B:	it, it's really quite, uh, quite amazing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	unseasonable.
A:	I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring,
A:	it was so much ice that came down, later on that that afternoon and evening,
B:	Um. Yes,
A:	it was just, it was horrible.
B:	I was just talking to my son today,
B:	he's up in Boston,
B:	and it was twenty-nine there
B:	and it was, you know, in the seventies out here
B:	and, it was really, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he really wished he could be here, rather than there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, um, I don't know
A:	I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather.
B:	Oh really.
A:	Um, I, I like it warmer,
A:	I mean I like it, you know, I like it warm
A:	but it doesn't really matter.
A:	I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
A:	but, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I have, you know,
B:	I, I,
B:	I think it's really been delightful.
B:	I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas
B:	and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all.
A:	Well I spent three years in Germany,
A:	so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway
A:	But I got used to it,
A:	it was really strange,
A:	I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just swelter
A:	and then we got used to it
A:	and then we went up to Dallas
A:	and it was just,
A:	it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry,
A:	it's just not very comfortable,
A:	it just,
B:	do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a little bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You must, well, uh,
B:	it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister,
A:	we were, we were down there
A:	and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride with my sister
A:	and the air conditioning went out on the car
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,
B:	Oh yes.
A:	and this,
A:	it was just,
A:	the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus
A:	and it was just killing us.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	it's terrible.
B:	Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, that's really bad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or, you know,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	just, you know, so mild,
A:	and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat,
A:	you know you're sweating,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you look down at your arm,
A:	but you see the water leaving your arm,
A:	it's so hot, you just feel it pulling away, bizarre.
B:	Oh wow, uh.
B:	I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh it doesn't,
B:	some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons
B:	but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, it's kind of a luxury.
A:	I tend to agree
A:	but, I don't know,
A:	I, I think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten.
A:	No,
A:	the other topics.
A:	I got one topic,
A:	they said talk about the Middle East well,
B:	I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think about what
B:	my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.
B:	We messed up the conversation, anyway.
A:	Well I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty controversial topics
A:	so it's just like well that was my fault.
A:	But then the weather's like,
A:	man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane,
A:	I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	weather's just not all that inspiring.
B:	Okay,
B:	well it's nice talking to you.
A:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	pretty good,
B:	pretty good.
B:	So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *listen
A:	Drug testing in the work place.
A:	Um. I've been tested a few times, just before drug employment.
A:	But that's about it.
A:	I've never had random drug testing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have random drug testing at, in my business,
B:	but I've never been, uh, never had to do it.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they started that about a year ago,
B:	and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,
B:	at least that's.
A:	Oh, they do with alcohol.
B:	Pardon?
A:	They do it with alcohol?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they, they, they'll check for alcohol.
A:	Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
B:	No,
B:	once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing.
A:	Huh. That's interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a,
A:	What type of field of work are you in?
B:	I'm in the oil business.
A:	Oh, in the oil business.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	and you work in the office around.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I work in the office,
B:	so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags for the cars,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and we work around a lot of explosives.
B:	Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so that's, you know,
A:	I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,
A:	and so they could blow up the whole,
A:	well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,
A:	but still, it can be dangerous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, I, I, I agree.
B:	I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know,
B:	if it's,
B:	as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,
B:	as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.
A:	Now do they fire them, or do they?
B:	Well, see, this is it,
B:	this is where I start having my problems with my company.
B:	I work for a private company,
B:	and and the policy is something like, see if I can state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.
A:	Huh, that's.
A:	I think our policy is that,
A:	all right, it's probably the same thing.
A:	I'm not really sure what the
B:	Yeah,
B:	really,
B:	it's one of those things that you read once,
B:	and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it
A:	That's right.
A:	But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,
A:	but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
B:	I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.
A:	Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,
B:	Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment
B:	and, you know, it's not,
B:	I guess I haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, so I you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,
B:	I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A and B are going to be in
B:	and next week, C and D are going to come in
A:	You could time it just right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	right.
A:	I know one employee,
A:	I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,
A:	and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
A:	That'd be just as dangerous.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.
A:	Huh. That's true.
B:	You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do they give any limits on alcohol,
A:	or is it?
B:	Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
B:	I don't think they do.
B:	Um, well, they must,
B:	I mean, gee whiz.
B:	That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,
B:	because I, I really don't know.
B:	I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
A:	Oh.
B:	Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.
B:	Uh, there was a company in Houston that,
B:	they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of,
B:	it was not only drugs,
A:	Okay Karen.
A:	you're first.
B:	Okay.
B:	I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental.
A:	Okay.
B:	They're also important.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association
B:	Um.
A:	so there is a progressive path,
A:	but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh, like really,
B:	Um.
B:	Are they like pretty much train for a specific job
B:	and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	somewhat that,
A:	but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,
A:	uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.
A:	But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,
B:	Well, you know that's interesting though.
B:	Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.
B:	I use to think that, you know, after you work,
B:	you mean security, job security?
A:	Job security,
A:	yes.
B:	Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,
B:	but I don't know if it is so much anymore.
B:	In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, it wasn't necessarily,
B:	I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we are seeing that here as well.
A:	Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No doubt
A:	But,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,
A:	it's where it's most expedient which, Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's  often the lowest support type roles.
B:	Expedient,
B:	yeah
B:	that's exactly it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
B:	See, yeah.
A:	So we,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think that's one of the things too.
B:	You get too many management people, you know.
A:	It's very easy.
B:	Yeah
B:	and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.
B:	Well, those people aren't there anymore.
A:	Right.
A:	Because it's support people that are providing  the speed for it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but,
B:	so what else do you think is important?
A:	Well the, uh,
A:	that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because my perspective is from an institution,
A:	uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess innovation,
A:	although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly
A:	and so you can see the reward of the efforts.
B:	I think probably in a small,
B:	yeah,
B:	I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing.
B:	You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.
A:	Right.
B:	Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You end up being your own person
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem
A:	and you know you really,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	whereas yeah in a smaller,
B:	I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Hi.
A:	Okay.
A:	So, uh, with the issue of trial by jury, uh, I actually found the whole question about whether you need a, a a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually, I, I agree that that's an interesting thing.
B:	I, I believe that's a, for, for civil suits it's not unanimous, right,
B:	but for, for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law?
A:	I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases where, uh, I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I actually thought I'd read that, too
B:	and that's why I phrased it that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wonder,
B:	the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,
B:	and things that are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,
B:	but I don't know what the, the laws,
B:	do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous?
A:	Well, I'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is.
A:	And I, I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.
A:	But I don't know whether you need an, a unanimous, uh, vote of not guilty to acquit.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that would be an interesting change.
B:	It was also allow the, uh, idea that if you had one person who was, uh, very disagreeable that, I mean, it, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because, uh, the fact that it's the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, uh, criterion that it, uh, increases the, the likelihood of getting the proper judgment.
B:	So, I, I think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'd agree with that.
A:	But I've never had the, the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, I guess, about five years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually I, I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do.
A:	But,
B:	I would like to do that.
B:	I've been out here twenty some years
B:	and I've been called, uh, three different times,
B:	but I've never actually even made it into the, the jury box. And, because there have always been a number of people
A:	Oh.
B:	and, and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions.
B:	Uh, I,
B:	yeah,
B:	I also think that would be really good.
B:	I,
A:	the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else.
B:	Well, the, the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's, an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that that, uh, peer pressure,
B:	and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'd read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at what had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations.
B:	Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I understand.
B:	You, you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, uh, to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response.
B:	I think of the movie, uh, TWELVE ANGRY MEN.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You ever seen that movie?
A:	Yeah,
A:	once.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	it's, it's, it's exactly that situation where, uh,
B:	it's Henry Fonda
B:	and it's eleven to one
B:	and he's the one,
B:	I, I believe he was opposed to the conviction
B:	and, uh, and he held on
B:	and,
A:	Hi.
A:	So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?
B:	Uh, actually no,
B:	because, because I'm in school.
B:	I, I kind of miss out on most of the current events.
B:	I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it.
A:	Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?
B:	Uh, I don't watch a lot of it,
B:	but that's the
B:	basically that's my only major source of information.
A:	Um.
B:	What about, what about you?
A:	Well, I read, uh,
A:	I get a bunch of different things.
A:	I get a newspaper every day
A:	and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that
A:	and I look through, uh,
A:	I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much read that cover to cover
A:	and I, as far as, you know,
A:	that satisfies most of the short term news I get.
A:	Uh, don't watch much T V,
A:	don't have enough time
A:	and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,
A:	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's about all I ever hear of it.
A:	Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK
A:	and for the longer term I, I read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they,
A:	the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news,
A:	but it's recent material.
B:	And it's more in depth.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is, it is more in depth, less broad.
A:	Well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,
A:	but it's just more in depth
A:	and, uh, it is, it is more it is more just significant information, you know.
A:	It is the big events, not the little events.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know.
B:	I know,
B:	where they're just trying to fill in.
A:	Yes,
A:	or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow
B:	I know,
B:	I do, I do, too.
A:	and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like oh, so exciting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you may find one little, uh, news item interesting
B:	so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's about what it ends up being.
A:	Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually, you mention NEWSWEEK,
B:	I, I, I do like, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.
B:	I don't get to read it as much as I like,
B:	but that's, I think that's a good magazine.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think they're about the same.
A:	I, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.
A:	And, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you,
A:	I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring?
B:	Well right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit.
A:	I think it will,
A:	uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence,
A:	but we've yet to see it
A:	and
A:	it's real short term yet, though,
A:	I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they like to tell us that it's going to be important
B:	I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting
A:	I think it is, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I think that's a possibility,
A:	uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	definitely.
A:	For the companies that already have a presence over there
A:	and, uh, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time.
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	so they have a toe hold,
B:	I good toe hold.
A:	Yep.
A:	Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand.
A:	But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist
B:	so,
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,
A:	even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like, England doesn't want to do one thing
A:	and, and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing
A:	and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And some of it, I mean, is,
A:	I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I can understand their viewpoint,
B:	they're just, they're starting off,
B:	their economy's a little bit weak,
B:	so you want to get established before they
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Before they open up their borders to everyone.
B:	Yeah,
B:	totally.
A:	Uh, what is the, uh,
A:	do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that?
B:	Actually I'm not really into sports.
B:	My roommates are,
B:	so, unfortunately, I forced to watch quite a bit of sports.
A:	Against your will.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have to, fight over the remote control.
A:	Yeah,
A:	at least you guys have a remote control.
A:	It's sometimes better to not have one of those.
A:	Course, you can always mislocate it. Or misplace it, I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it
A:	and,
A:	So, what kind of music you into?
B:	Well, I have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music.
B:	In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that I don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal.
A:	The opera, yeah, it's right on track.
A:	I like classical,
A:	but I can't deal with opera at all.
A:	And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy.
A:	I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's, it's got to have a point to it.
B:	Oh, I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,
B:	but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal which seems to be music to annoy you, is, uh, gets a little annoying.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What kind of progressive stuff?
B:	Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know,
B:	I'm thirty,
B:	so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and R E M, that sort of stuff.
A:	uh.
B:	Uh, R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point,
B:	and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, a lot of people like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's pretty much, you know, bull.
A:	Because R E M really hasn't changed.
A:	If, it's, it's interesting.
A:	They're producing, uh, similar music
A:	and it's good music
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, you know, people have picked up on it.
A:	That's good.
B:	I think it is.
A:	I'm impressed.
B:	Uh, for a while there, music seemed to really popular music seemed to have, uh, not a lot of point to it.
B:	I was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton.
B:	Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he, he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And I could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.
A:	Uh, but he picked the right songs
A:	and and that that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter.
B:	I guess.
B:	That, and a marvelous hairdo.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm sure that, that that sold a lot for him.
A:	That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop.
A:	I'm I've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop.
A:	It just seems like there's no, no real point.
A:	You hear the same, same tune over and over again in a thousand guises
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Well, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like a lot of classical music,
B:	but I also dislike, uh, some classical music,
B:	and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music, and feel that if, if it's not seventy five years old, it hasn't stood the test of time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can, I can believe that.
A:	What kind of things are you, do you like in classical?
A:	What's the standard?
B:	Uh,
B:	Stuff that I like,
B:	uh, I like Bach.
B:	I tolerate Vivaldi.
B:	I can't, stand, uh, uh, Debussy or Debussy different
B:	Uh, uh, I like Tchaikovsky.
B:	He can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	Uh, and some of, some stuff that I like, uh,
B:	for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's interesting music,
B:	but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic, uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive.
B:	You know, we're, we're, much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth,
B:	that's right, you know,
B:	we'll do, we'll do the ninth
B:	and everyone will know it and and hum it
A:	It's safe.
B:	and it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me.
B:	Uh, I feel that, uh, that, that music should take chances in one way or another and that, uh, you know, if you've heard a piece, oh, a hundred, a hundred times,
A:	Do you think that there's any way that, uh,
A:	or do you think there's too much crime now?
A:	I mean, I guess, any crime is too much
A:	but, It's out of control.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, well, uh, out of control, I don't know.
B:	I guess it could be worse.
B:	Uh, we've, uh, we've, we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood.
B:	Uh, I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington.
B:	Uh, there's, uh, there's a lot of problems.
B:	I mean, there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people
B:	and, uh, you know, we get cars on our block, uh, regularly, uh, uh, uh, gone through, rifled through and stuff.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would not of, okay, I would not have guessed that in Seattle.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you figured it was like Omaha, right?
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
B:	No,
B:	it's, uh, it's not Newark,
B:	but, uh, yeah
B:	it's got problems.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I wonder, I mean, I wonder what, what really is the answer.
A:	I mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think most people regard it as a warehouse. Where you put away the people that are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room
A:	and we, we try to put aside in the warehouse,
A:	and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	That's what I hear.
A:	So it's, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think, you know,
B:	don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea?
A:	I get the feeling that a lot of people have.
A:	I'm not convinced that I have.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, see, I mean, my mom taught English as a second language
A:	and, and she was dealing mostly with people that were, were in on drug crimes
A:	and, uh,
B:	Oh, you mean she taught in a prison?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh.
A:	In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia.
B:	I see.
B:	uh.
A:	And, the problem she had was not with the inmates at all.
A:	The, the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison.
A:	I mean, It was, it was, I mean,
B:	Yeah,
B:	the the bureaucracy.
A:	they, they put her, I mean,
A:	I didn't, obviously I didn't see the classroom, uh, and, hopefully never will,
A:	but, uh they, they put her at the end of a hallway,
A:	there were no other classes going on at the time
A:	and they refused to let her wear a body a body alarm. Which,
B:	Uh.
A:	and
A:	I don't know exactly what that is,
A:	but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and, and really annoy a lot of people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, you know
B:	So she didn't feel safe.
A:	No,
A:	she didn't.
A:	She didn't,
A:	she, she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates,
A:	and then later on the, uh, the administration kept getting worse,
A:	and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the States, she decided that it was too,
A:	she didn't feel that public schools were were safe,
A:	so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Well, at least it's maximum security, right
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, but the point that was, that it, you know,
A:	you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible
A:	and, and I'm, I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that run the system have given up on it.
B:	Uh, well, I, I think the people that run, yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.
A:	Uh.
B:	I mean, I, uh, you know, I, I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff
B:	and it's, uh,
B:	you can get pretty hardened, I'm sure.
A:	But getting, I mean, well, see,
A:	I always have problems because, because I can never decide whether or not I'm, I'm supposed to be a conservative or, or a liberal
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	But I keep, I keep thinking that there's got to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances.
B:	Those are funny see
A:	I mean, I can't help but wonder if, if I grew up without a father, on the streets, and with like little or no money, wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison this
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, Oh, yeah,
B:	absolutely.
B:	I think, uh, yeah, I think you can blame it on social problems.
B:	Sure.
A:	I mean, I don't know.
B:	I mean, as, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's been more crime.
A:	We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't  get onto the program.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's not enough  beds and treatment programs, rising drug abuse,
B:	and, yep,
B:	it's a mess.
A:	I don't, I don't remember the, the gentleman's name,
A:	but the, the, uh, the mayor of Baltimore is a, is a Rhodes Scholar
A:	and what he,
B:	Is he the guy wants to, like, deregulate heroin, or something?
A:	Well, what he wants to do is take all the money that, uh, he gets for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Stop trying to attack supply because, which, which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't.
A:	I mean, Switzerland tried the, the grand experiment
A:	and, you know, they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park
A:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	Jonathan, uh, you you say it's near and dear to your heart.
A:	Buying a car is, uh, something you're contemplating, I take it.
B:	Uh, fantasizing about.
A:	Uh.
B:	Can't do it right now.
B:	Our situation is that we're a two car family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago.
A:	Uh
B:	It's got a, uh, five year loan,
B:	so that's still got a couple years to run
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the car I get to drive is a, uh, Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month
B:	so, I think about, uh, sprucing that up in a couple years if I can.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you think you'll, uh, what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?
B:	Well since I just turned forty, I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something, uh, something real sporty
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, realistically with, uh, the need to take the kids to school, probably have to have something that, uh, wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. *spelling wined should be wind
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	a seating room.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I think the next car we get will probably be a well
A:	I, I like Buicks.
A:	We have a Buick Century now,
A:	it's a nineteen eighty-seven
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, whatever I get, I want to have, uh, air bags, uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down to get over,
A:	so I think the four door is probably a major requirement
B:	Sure.
A:	and, other than that, uh, you know, reasonable cost and safety and, uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car.
A:	Uh, you know, I'm not looking for one with a great big engine, uh
B:	Sure.
A:	something that will carry it around careful, I guess is best, best way to describe it.
A:	Right now, we've got a V six
A:	and it, that seems to be just fine.
A:	I know they they're coming out with some V eight now
A:	and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back,
B:	so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, V eights seem to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.
A:	Right.
A:	I, uh, I drive a, a truck, a Ford truck.
A:	I, I like trucks because they're spacious,
A:	and it's handy to haul things.
A:	Uh, it's not related to my business,
A:	I just really use it, basically, for transportation,
A:	but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that,
A:	and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one.
B:	Sure.
B:	Is, uh, traction much of an issue for you up there.
A:	Traction?
A:	Uh, not really, uh, you know,
A:	it's a two wheel drive truck
A:	and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home anyway
B:	Actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it,
B:	yeah.
B:	We, uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago.
A:	Wow.
B:	A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm
B:	and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car,
B:	and, this is a rear wheel drive model.
B:	So, we got some monster studded snow tires after that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Haven't had any problems since.
A:	What kind of, what make is the mini van?
B:	It's a Mazda.
A:	Mazda,
A:	I see.
B:	And, uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, uh, driveability.
B:	Fuel economy isn't great, being a mini van,
B:	but, uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others
B:	and it's, uh, got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around
A:	Right.
B:	so we've been able to do some real creative, uh, load hauling when called upon.
A:	One of my sons has a, a Plymouth, uh, van or, you know, uh, uh, that same type of thing, the Voyager, I guess
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, they have a, a child that's five years old
A:	and it's really handy for hauling him around and, and their stuff,
A:	and, of course, as he gets friends, I'm sure that will be even handier.
A:	So, I know if we were, if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that we're going to be, uh, owning a mini van for some years to come.
B:	Probably till the kids are out of, uh, high school anyway.
A:	What about, uh, all wheel drive?
A:	Is that something that you'd be interested in
A:	or is that,
B:	Uh I'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And even as, as light as that is with, uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, I probably don't want to be driving anyway.
A:	Right.
B:	So I know I'd be happy with a, a reasonable, uh, four door.
B:	You know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with getting kids into the,
A:	What kind of crime do you think, uh, is the most prevalent in our society?
B:	Oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.
A:	Such as New York City
B:	Is that what happens up there a lot?
B:	Uh, that, that's mostly what I hear, is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen.
B:	That's the most prevalent crime. Uh, the ones that really, you know, the ones that really add up after a while, I guess, you know, from, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.
B:	You know, everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, I mean, so many people use it,
A:	and even though just using is not really,
A:	I mean it is a crime,
B:	Oh, well, yeah,
B:	that, that, that is a crime.
B:	I guess, uh, when you, when you count all the little things that people do like,
B:	uh, speeding is a crime
A:	Well, that's true.
B:	I break that law every day
A:	But I was, I, I was staying in the realm of, of felonies versus misdemeanors and, uh, drug use,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,
A:	but, uh, what kind, what kind,
A:	have you been, uh, have you been the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything?
B:	Well, I've, uh, I've been caught with marijuana before,
B:	so I guess that was a crime.
B:	I got a year's probation for that,
B:	but, uh,
A:	That, that's not that much.
A:	I mean  you know, those aren't,
B:	No,
B:	it wasn't that  big a deal.
A:	I,
B:	Uh, when I think of crime, I think of stuff that, that affects other people like people getting, you know, killed or raped.
B:	I think rape is one of the worst crimes
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it is.
A:	I, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's very degrading
A:	Uh,
A:	Murder, murder is, is hard on the people that were related to
A:	you know, I mean, it is a rather final solution,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	once, once a person's, you know, gone, then it's,
B:	but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life, you know.
A:	Yes.
A:	What, what do you think is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder or something like that.
B:	Well for, for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death penalty is,
B:	it's a pretty good thing.
A:	I agree with that.
B:	They, they have that down here in Florida still.
B:	They the electric chair
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think Virginia does, too, up here.
B:	Oh, do they?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think, I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy
B:	and, I guess usually they're, they're always sure they got the right guy,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think the appeal process takes too long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so do I.
A:	I think, I, I think it should take, from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year.
B:	Yeah,
B:	if that.
B:	You know, the sooner,
B:	a, a, a year's plenty of time you know, for something to come out, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then, you know, there's been guys in jail for six years
B:	and the other guy admits that he did it
B:	and they
B:	it's like oops,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I mean, the system isn't perfect,
A:	I mean, it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans.
A:	You do the best you can to make it perfect, you know,
A:	you, you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect.
B:	Right.
A:	But, I think you have to accept some of the errors.
A:	I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if, if there was a credible punishment, uh, for murderers.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	I don't know if it would or not though.
B:	I, I don't think it's a, so much of a deterrent as, as it is a, a good, uh, a good way for vengeance, you know, for the relatives and, and family members,
B:	you know what I mean?
A:	And society probably, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, just general society to,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it kind of gets it off their chest.
A:	Uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it does
A:	and, and it decreases the prison population. And, which is significant
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know that a, a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other.
A:	I mean, Yeah.
B:	And they're the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.
B:	I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead,
B:	but, I, you might be able to, uh, stop people, you know,
B:	they're thinking about it,
B:	they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught.
A:	Yeah,
A:	generally the crimes of passion and things like that, uh, are not premeditated.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, they can be,
A:	but usually they aren't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're spur of the moment
B:	That's right.
A:	and, uh, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and plans, when you catch those, those individuals, I think that you, you end up with a, uh, uh, how do I want to, you end up with a you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they could probably do it again.
A:	Yes,
A:	they, they would have no problems doing it again.
B:	That's right,
B:	they didn't have any time doing it the first time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do a, any good because as a, as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay, you know, one and a,
B:	No,
B:	it
B:	Okay.
B:	Thanks.
A:	Huh.
A:	Do you all have a budget?
B:	Well, uh, yeah,
B:	we, we do.
B:	Um, we've been married for twenty-three years
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have, uh, three teenage daughters
B:	and, you know, they're very expensive.
B:	So, uh, uh, we, yeah, we have somewhat of, uh, a system.
B:	Uh, it's, it's kind of, uh, you know, it's kind of hard to explain.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We've actually gone, uh, just recently, to you know having, having two checking accounts.
B:	We always had just one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And now we are having two.
B:	Uh, it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	So, I have to be.
B:	That's that's kind of the way I feel about it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I usually, uh,
A:	my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances
A:	and of course, we're like like a lot of people.
A:	We just scramble through month to month, you know.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Do you have a two income family or one income?
A:	Uh, we have a two income uh family.
B:	Yeah.
A:	She also works
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, but she, she enjoys it
A:	and she's good at it.
A:	Uh, if it's, if it's,
A:	I am kind of, uh, uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and one of these days I am going to do something about that
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know how that goes,
A:	but, uh, uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well.
A:	She, uh she writes all the checks, you know, once a month.
B:	So your wife,
B:	Yes.
B:	It
B:	that
B:	what
B:	her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or accounting?
A:	Uh, sort of on a peripheral.
A:	She's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator
B:	Oh.
A:	and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, but she enjoys it.
A:	She likes keeping track of all that stuff
A:	and, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that's sort of related to her field a little bit.
A:	Yeah
A:	sort of.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we, you know, we've experimented with, with, uh, budgets, you know from time to time, uh,
A:	but, if, you know,
A:	you have to keep up with them.
A:	So a lot of times, we just, uh, just kind of play it by ear.
A:	We try to keep our, uh, our retirement and our savings kind of automated
B:	Yeah.
A:	so we never see that money.
A:	Just like taken directly.
B:	It's just taking it out, right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We do the same thing.
A:	And that, that's kind of handy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because if you don't see it, you don't miss it
B:	Yeah,
B:	if
A:	You don't spend it.
B:	you have something to take it out.
B:	That's exactly what we've always done
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we've had, uh, they've always had, uh, where they match your funds, you know,
B:	sometimes if you, if you save so much, then they will match it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that, you know, we've done that too.
B:	But, my husband works for an insurance company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess.
B:	But he was with another company before that,
B:	but we have, we have,
B:	I, I work also,
B:	but I only have a part time job
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I get paid very little
B:	but, uh, you know, I try to use that money for food
B:	Jim gives me a certain amount money.
B:	You know, we just transfer it into my account
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I use that for food, household expenses,
B:	and then I add my own check to that
B:	and then with that I try and handle, you know, some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but the expenses that we need and have around the house.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It  sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.
B:	So.
A:	Just kind of play it by ear, but keep the, the deductions  you know
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we
B:	well Jim has, Jim has a budget.
B:	I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, you know. I am given so much money a month,
B:	so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I try not to, you know,
B:	we don't, you know, I don't ask for more.
B:	I mean I just try and make it on that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
B:	Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you can, you can really waste a lot of money that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, well how long have you been married?
A:	Uh, about five years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So you're just really getting started
B:	So do you have a family too?
A:	Uh, I've got one little girl.
A:	She's like, uh, nineteen months.
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, she's, she's not, uh,
B:	She hasn't effected your budget yet really.
A:	Not, not really.
A:	Not too bad. Uh.
B:	No.
B:	Not like she will later on.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You will see that  all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
A:	Yeah
A:	when,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	what can we do here
B:	and then you have to really sit down and plan some more
B:	and, uh, but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and more of that.
B:	You know, more budgeting as as they got older.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but uh, but what do you do?
B:	Do you,
A:	I'm uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I work at a, for a university. Uh, Georgia Tech, uh, research
B:	Oh.
B:	Well good.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Good.
A:	So I just, uh,
B:	Well, we just have, you know, we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta.
B:	I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things.
B:	I'd better get back to the subject.
A:	Oh, well
B:	But, uh, budgeting.
B:	I found, you know, I feel a lot better.
B:	You know, we use to work out of one check book
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending
B:	and it's so much easier,
B:	Uh, well, having
B:	of the reason going through the school system
B:	I seem to be younger than most people who, who talk on this thing.
B:	I'm, I'm just graduating graduating from college.
B:	Uh, I didn't really perceive much of a, of a problem with the school system.
B:	However, when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and
B:	you can compare just about thing to Japan
B:	need to separate every th and we look like we don't have anything.
B:	Uh, it seems to be not difficult enough for students. Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough.
B:	Uh, however, I, if it weren't for our needless, uh, competition with Japan, I, I'd, I'd think that, that, the school systems, system works at a pretty good pace.
A:	I don't know.
A:	Uh, I haven't,
A:	it's been, uh, well seventy-nine since I was at school. At high school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I've seen things change.
A:	I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually,
A:	because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then
A:	so it's hard to compare.
A:	You know what I mean?
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, it seems like when I I lived in Chicago,
A:	I, I've lived down here.
A:	I hear the dropout rates from the schools,
A:	and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth.
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean, I, I've seen so many different things. So, so many different bad reports coming out of the school system
A:	and I recognize that there are good schools out there.
A:	I mean, somebody's  getting, getting a good education because we, continue to employ people.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, I don't, I don't understand the, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities.
B:	Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either.
B:	Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools.
B:	But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas,
B:	it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and, and crime.
B:	And they all seem to go together.
B:	And it seems like if you could eliminate one of, of the parts of that circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better.
B:	So, uh, the other two
B:	they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix
B:	but it's just like, I, I don't expect them to know which, which, which part is best to fix just like I don't know.
B:	It's, it's a complicated issue.
B:	I, I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.
A:	I don't know if I blame it on the school.
A:	I think, I think I blame it, I think I blame it on a couple of different things.
A:	I think I blame it on the school system. Uh,
B:	Well, that's I meant when I said the school.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't blame it on the teachers in the school.
A:	I, although I think that,
A:	I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than,
A:	well, they do quite well for themselves
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid.
A:	No.
A:	Not all school districts are well paid.
A:	But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid.
A:	I mean I know one family that's got,
A:	they're both teachers,
A:	and they both have, like second jobs that they work in the afternoons.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They both work all summer full-time.
A:	And from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it, it,
A:	I mean that family is making over a hundred grand.
A:	And I'm,
A:	I mean, okay,
A:	okay.
A:	Yes,
A:	I agree that teaching our kids is important.
B:	Right.
A:	However, these people who only work eight hours day at it, from seven to three,
A:	and they only work nine months a year
A:	and they get an awful lot of breaks in between
A:	and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that.
A:	And I don't even have kids
B:	Yeah,
B:	well that's true.
B:	But there's,
B:	you can always play games with, uh, talking about, whoa, look at this.
B:	My tax dollars are paying for this.
B:	This is wrong.
B:	But, when you're
B:	and there's really not much you can directly do about that.
B:	I think that, that if, if there is a problem with the school system, uh, from, it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, uh, paid. That perhaps that might be one area that, that could be improved.
B:	Uh,
B:	you have other professional jobs
B:	and this is a profession.
B:	And, as a matter of fact, it's a pretty big influence on, on
A:	So, do you, your privacy being invaded at any time?
B:	Well, uh, one of the things that, uh, that I found to be, uh, an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the, on the, uh, credit card bill.
B:	That  is something that is not required
A:	Well,
A:	Right.
B:	and, in fact, uh, it is actually prohibited
B:	but it doesn't stop many people many people from, uh, from doing it.
B:	And it's one of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, uh, research.
B:	And to get your, your phone number on, uh, uh, lists for phone solicitations.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now that you can still, yeah,
A:	I've always done that.
A:	I started,
A:	once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse
A:	and I say what are you going to do.
A:	You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then  that's fine.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all.
A:	And then, ultimately, they say, no
A:	you don't have to put it down
A:	But, uh, really it's part of this compliance thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, the thing I don't like,
A:	I know that certain states actually sell their, uh, their lists like, uh, motor vehicles.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That really burns me because, hey, you're required.
A:	You have to do that.
B:	Right.
A:	And nowhere does it say you asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that, it, it's one thing to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks.
A:	You can always refuse
A:	but it's another thing where it's required by law
A:	and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody.  You know,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh, That,
A:	I don't think, I don't think they have the right to do that.
B:	I agree with you there.
B:	That's something that, uh, people have seen.
B:	Oh, here's an easy way to make some money.
B:	But, uh, I don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not.
B:	I, I've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state.
B:	Uh, the budget problems up here are, are pretty tense.
B:	And people are looking for alternate ways of, uh,
B:	enhancing revenue is the, uh, phrase they use.
B:	And they were talking about selling the D M V lists
B:	and there was a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, consternation about that
B:	and the last I heard they'd backed down from that idea.
B:	But it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, uh, public that you, don't know about.
A:	Well, that's easy.
A:	Whenever you donate money to someone?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They, you become, put on something like a sucker list
A:	and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations.
B:	Right.
A:	And then you
A:	it kind of makes you feel from doing it again.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like, uh, National Public Radio or any of these, the public, uh, stations, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I, I, I think I sent in, in money for, once to, uh, to public, uh, T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine.
B:	Huh.
A:	I,
A:	it's like
A:	and it just started soon after I had done that one.
B:	Right.
A:	And I just said this is, this is terrible
A:	Uh, and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it's one thing,
A:	they don't sell the list.
A:	But the thing that makes me mad is, uh, then they start getting, uh, other people,
A:	the people do these phonathons
B:	Right.
A:	and they call you up
A:	and they actually happen to be people who are, graduated in your class or something like that.
A:	And, and they say, oh, we, we know you.
A:	You, uh, had, uh, contributed x amount last year.
A:	Can you do better this year?
A:	And, you know, like hold on here.
B:	How do you know that?
A:	Who, how do you know that?
A:	Why, why you even telling me this?
A:	Is it any of your business?
A:	I mean, it's one thing that I, and the college knows that
A:	that's, just our business.
A:	There's no need for someone  who is soliciting should know at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just, uh,
A:	and that was very offensive too.
A:	I,
A:	and so very
B:	Last year, the, uh, Lotus Development Company, the, uh company that puts out One, Two, Three was planning on marketing a, uh, C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right
B:	One way or another we're now recording.
A:	Okay.
B:	Um, um, oh, yeah.
B:	Home repair.
A:	You were helping your parents.
B:	Right.
B:	I still am really.
B:	They're, uh, like some sort of sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta, in Candler Park.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we've done lots to it.
B:	We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them.
B:	And,
A:	So you're remodeling?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I, I just live in a, I live in an apartment now.
A:	I, uh, two summers ago I went to Massachusetts
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I went with a friend of mine
A:	and we undertook a building house.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And this was a, a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions
A:	and it's preconstructed you might say.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And we started in, uh, we, started from an empty lot with, uh, trees and stuff on it
A:	and we had to cut them, uh, down and clear the lot.
A:	We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and, uh, went from the ground up.
B:	Wow.
A:	Our  one of our main problems was,
B:	Wow.
A:	well in Massachusetts, I thought I was going to,
A:	well, it was a, a fun time
A:	but  I thought, gosh, summer time, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, all it ever did was rain and thunder storms
A:	And one thing is that we're, we had, we were going to pour the basement foundation.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we're in the process
A:	and it started pouring down rain.
B:	Huh.
A:	And I guess we had most of it done
A:	but the end was result,
A:	what happened was that some of the, the a lot of water settled on the top
A:	and it really didn't give a very good finish
A:	and some of the,
A:	it was sort of sandy and  and not, uh, a very good finish.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it turned, it was okay
A:	and it's only the basement floor
A:	so it was okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, it kept us pretty busy.
A:	It was only, uh,
A:	there was, well me and my friend
A:	and then we just had like two helpers and  uh, sort of a, a family type,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it wasn't, you know, like a commercial project or something.
A:	It was sort of just, you know, uh, gets your, get his, you know, my my brother and well, maybe, you know, my cousin's coming over today to help us do that  kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow.
A:	And, and then materials coming in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we're, we're hopping around pretty good.
A:	But overall, yeah, we got it done
A:	and it's a three bedroom, two bath house
A:	and it's pretty neat.
B:	Nice.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Nice.
B:	So, uh, I mean what was it for?
B:	You just,
A:	Well, it was, uh, for my friend's parents.
A:	They had some property there
A:	and they'd lived in this, this old,
A:	it's sort of like a farm, you might say.
A:	And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And his mom just wanted a, a new house. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that has been her dream.
A:	And so, we did that.
A:	And, uh, she was really pleased with it.
A:	So it came  really great
B:	That's great.
A:	so.
B:	Wow.
A:	So what, why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot.
B:	Huh?
A:	Where you live it gets very hot?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does.
A:	And that's why you,
A:	and the windows have you, what type of windows are you putting in?
B:	Huh.
A:	Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in, uh, you know, the solar game?
B:	Right.
A:	Have you,
A:	what, what, are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or,
B:	No.
B:	We just, we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass.
B:	My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	And, uh, but it,
B:	see in a lot of the windows?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's, the house is eighty years old
B:	and it's had several owners and stuff
B:	and, uh  they have put plastic, Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows.
A:	Okay.
A:	Oh, these
A:	so you have the sash windows in?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Did uh, did it go up and down?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And so, uh, and, and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Yes,
A:	there's a problem with those.
A:	Those are, uh,
A:	they usually most of the time don't open very well
B:	Yeah.
B:	Ours didn't
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the ones that would open, uh, wouldn't want to stay open
B:	They wanted  to slam shut.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they also, there, they, they,
A:	a lot of vibration
A:	and it causes the glass to crack
A:	and it's  a never ending problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. So I haven't, uh, I haven't been in any really home repair things lately.
A:	I,
A:	Uh, being a former drug user I, uh, I, I guess I have to say at this point, that I do approve of it.
B:	Whoa.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, because I know that, uh, in using drugs I was not a good employee.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there, uh,
A:	whenever you are an employee of the company, you are using its assets,
A:	and, uh, you are also under their liability, under the Workmen's Comp.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases
B:	Where do you work?
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, it's also a retreading plant,
A:	and that's where most of our, uh, injuries occur.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an, if a, a break or a man, uh, has an accident.
A:	Then he's automatically, uh, given a drug test.
B:	Right.
B:	Do they do it, like, you know, within hours of the accident,
B:	or is it?
A:	Yes,
A:	when he goes to the doctor the first time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so, that kind of, uh,
A:	I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started using it oh, for the past year or so.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now we've let some people go, uh, that we, was found that drugs were used in their system.
A:	Now, I don't know how T E C would handle it.
A:	They haven't pursued it, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, if there's some, uh, problem I know,
A:	there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,
A:	and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they showed it negative.
B:	Huh.
A:	So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's probably true, too.
B:	That's, that's, that's sort of scary.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	really.
A:	And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And he tested positive on cocaine.
A:	Now then you always wonder, well is he just saying that
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	really,
B:	really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's a bad situation.
B:	I think that probably, I think most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think they should.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm a T I employee
B:	and and, and, uh, I'm, I'm really gung ho for it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In fact I, you know,
B:	some of the places now, um, like I B M don't allow them smoking, you know in, in the plant.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	We, we have designated smoking areas.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, I work in sort of a building that's, that's not really, well
B:	it's on the campus of the T I facility,
B:	but it's a little bit, you know, separated.
B:	We lease the building.
B:	And it's, it's a factory environment.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they, they have designated smoking,
B:	but it's just wide open,
B:	it's not ventilated properly
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that's bad.
B:	But as far as the drugs, you know, being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's a, it's a definite, I think it's essential.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I, I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came, come up, you know,
B:	they never, they never called me,
B:	they never, you know,
B:	and finally, the day we declared war was my time
A:	You're kidding
B:	No
B:	And so, and, and my boss has, has gone for about like three times, I think.
B:	And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group
A:	The executives, right?
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	and of course, you know, they did being moved around and making specifically single them out when we started, you know, that they were going to do all them first.
A:	The executives?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Wouldn't that be awful if you were  if you were using, and, and oh, lose your job and everything.
B:	Which I thought was interesting
B:	Oh, man,
B:	yeah.
B:	Ooh, yeah.
A:	I can't believe I was so brazen before.
A:	I, like I say, I'm a former drug user,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I, I, well, I, I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior,
A:	and so I don't use drugs any more.
B:	Oh, what kind of drugs did you use, if you don't mind?
A:	Uh, marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines.
B:	Wow!
A:	Um, yes,
A:	uh-huh
A:	And all on the job, too.
B:	Really?
A:	You know, it had gotten that bad.
B:	Well, it's really lucky that you got away from that.
A:	Really,
B:	Cause that's really,  downward spiral.
A:	it's, it's
A:	life is so much more enjoyable.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's it.
A:	I mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Just life in general.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, well I'm definitely for it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Plus, you know, you, you want to think that, that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share, but that are not endangering your life,
A:	That's right.
B:	in some cases
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	like, uh, my husband, uh, several years back, worked for Motorola.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they had, you know,
B:	I mean it was a chemical handling type.
A:	Oh, goodness.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	And that's really, that's really frightening.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I think some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like, like I am.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	I would think there would be.
B:	Well, well you'd think so
B:	but, uh,
A:	But they weren't?
B:	I don't know if they do it till yet.
A:	Isn't that awful.
B:	Because when he was at,
B:	course now it's been years now, because it was before, it was even before they had the, the designated smoking  type stuff, you know, at T I.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I forgot what,
B:	I guess it was like eighty-four, eighty-five something like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they, at that time, they had no testing whatsoever.
A:	Huh.
B:	So that's scary
A:	Yeah.
A:	That reminds me of, uh,
A:	I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time,
A:	and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living.
A:	And she said, Oh, he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill, you know  where they go and dump all this toxic stuff.
B:	Oh, Lord.
B:	Oh.
A:	And I just, you know, went, Oh, where?
B:	Yeah,
B:	should we move?
A:	Let me move as far away as possible.
B:	Ooh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	That's awful.
A:	But, I'm proud, though, that, that, um, you know, I grew up in the sixties,
A:	and back then it was popular you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but people have really wizened, you know, become wise about drugs
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they really have a good campaign for the young people, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They know it's not smart,
A:	so. So, I guess it was just a generational thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	peer group is the other way now instead of,
A:	That's right,
A:	and that's good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's,
A:	That's the best way to stop it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, it really is.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I think we did it.
B:	Okay.
A:	So it's good talking to you.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you, Cathy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	bye-bye
A:	Okay,
A:	are you on any kind of, uh, regular exercise plan?
B:	I, I, yeah, I'm, yeah, I, I do aerobics, uh, step classes and, uh,  toning classes,
A:	Step classes?
B:	yes.
A:	What's that?
B:	It's, uh, it's a new, uh, form I think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established that early on then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that.
A:	Absolutely.
B:	Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried to do the DART.
B:	And, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that are out here in, in, uh, north Dallas as opposed to downtown,
B:	uh, to try to, to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area. You know, like New York does,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.
B:	Yeah.
A:	New York
A:	and some,  people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Someone made the analogy, uh, with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse.
A:	An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street.
A:	Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I drive to work every day by myself, uh, without even, even any thought of car pooling.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	And, uh, most people are that way. Because they're used to not having public transportation.
B:	Yep.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, but I,  here again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt. So and doing all these studies and the things
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.
A:	I felt that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying, you know.
B:	A little bit much.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yep.
B:	Yep.
B:	Oh, the
A:	Well, that's about all I can say at this time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I think so,
B:	I think that will probably do it,
B:	so.
A:	Okay,
A:	it's been real nice talking with you.
B:	Good enough.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, do you own a P C by the way?
A:	I'm guessing you probably do.
B:	I don't have one in my home here.
B:	My, um, parents have one
B:	and they live just about three miles away,
A:	Oh.
B:	so we use that one.
A:	I see.
B:	And my in-laws also have one,
B:	and they're almost as close.
A:	Right.
B:	They're in Richardson.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	And what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?
B:	Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we got,
B:	uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs,
A:	Great.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so we use those
B:	and there's some,
B:	whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game,
B:	so, that's part of it.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. Uh, his resume, his, uh, letter,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh,
B:	I'm, uh,
B:	my father had a software company,
A:	Oh.
B:	and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, they're kind of old older
A:	Right.
B:	so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Um, I I'm a, a writer by profession
A:	and, uh, when, when I was first here in, in Dallas or in Plano, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and I got an I B M Selectric. I thought I had died and gone to heaven because I thought, oh, they're so wonderful.
B:	Oh.
B:	I have one of those.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, then, um,
B:	Mine's broke at the moment,
B:	but
A:	Yeah,
A:	ours really needs to have some work done on it
A:	but, but then my husband, um, worked at T I
A:	and I got a, um, this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore, but he got a, um, uh, the, the T I professional and brought that home
A:	and I learned Wordstar on that,
B:	Oh.
A:	and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh,
B:	I did some typing for my father when he had the company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so I learned that on there too,
B:	that was,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you ever used, do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect?
A:	Or,
B:	I haven't.
B:	That's the one that my father,
B:	well, I guess I have used it once or twice.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.
A:	Right.
B:	He's got on I B M.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's probably where you've used it.
B:	And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Um,
A:	I have that on my, uh, computer here
A:	and also, um, I do some work at U T D
A:	and, uh, that's what they have there
A:	and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the you know, already know the, the software.
A:	And, um, I don't know from my own experience, um,
A:	WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have.
A:	It may be improved by now
A:	but,
B:	That's what I've heard.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, uh, Wordstar was never very intuitive to me.
A:	I mean you know, you,
A:	some of the commands just had nothing to do with, you know, what you were supposed to be doing what they, what they did on the computer
A:	but, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you had to, memorize it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	And, but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways.
A:	And you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have to, uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. Because it keeps track of all your footnotes.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, that's neat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.
B:	Oh, how wonderful.
A:	So, you know, it's just,
B:	That, I had heard that that was better. That was a better one.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything,
A:	and oh, it was just awful.
A:	So, um, I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled.
A:	But I think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I agree
A:	So, um, well, I have not really paid much attention because I
A:	clock,
A:	although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes
A:	so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C
B:	Not too much.
B:	What kind of, what kind of things do you write?
A:	Well, um, I was a technical writer for many years, um,
B:	Oh
A:	and my husband and I actually met in a computer company.
A:	Um, I was a tech writer
A:	and he was an engineer. And, uh, so I did tech writing for a number of years.
B:	to her Go talk to Daddy about it.
B:	Excuse me.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	to her Go on and talk to Daddy about it
B:	Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you.
B:	But you don't need to drag it down the hall
A:	Got a problem, huh?
A:	Um,
B:	Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged
A:	Oh. Trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, I have,
A:	um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, um, I have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.
A:	And, um, for a while I had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist.
A:	So I did some advertising and P R
A:	but,
B:	Huh.
A:	um, now I'm, actually I'm, I'm not working anymore.
A:	I'm a student, I'm a graduate student
A:	so I'm doing a lot of writing
A:	but, uh, now all of the scholastic majors though,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've done a little, a lot of different kinds,
A:	but I, I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers
A:	so that's been really great.
A:	And, uh, I'm, so I'm real spoiled.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm anxious some day to have one here.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm,
B:	and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again
B:	so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,
A:	Good.
B:	so.
A:	That's great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I've,
A:	Well, those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on
A:	and, you know, the, and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, um, I think that that would be a real, a real, uh, advantage to, to her to have that and, uh, do it early,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	so. Uh, do
B:	We've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.
A:	Oh, neat.
B:	And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	And so I decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
A:	Right
B:	So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
A:	That's great.
A:	Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life,
A:	so Might as well start now, huh?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
B:	I agree.
A:	Well, Nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly.
A:	This is really going to be fun I think,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, um, my husband is a ham radio operator
A:	and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the,
A:	Well, Steve, did you go to college?
B:	Yeah.
B:	In fact, I'm still going.
A:	Oh, that's good.
A:	So you probably could give some great advice.
B:	Uh, well, I don't know about that,
B:	but I, in fact, I'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, what's your what's your interest,
A:	your, uh,
B:	Uh, well, computer science and cognitive science.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	That, that's similar to what,
A:	I'm in a P H D program right now.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, uh, my area of expertise, it's information systems, which is a little bit less technical, I think, than, uh, than computer science.
A:	But my area of expertise is, uh, uh, human computer interaction.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study, uh, because it's of, I'm working with voice systems.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, so, good luck.
A:	I guess we should talk about giving advice, though.
A:	what, what type of advice do you think you'd give to a, a parent?
B:	To a parent?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, the thing is, when you're a kid and the kid at that age, especially if they're going into undergraduate, it seems like they think they know what they want.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	An, and, I mean, choosing from my experience, you know, I thought, you know, my, I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I don't know,
B:	at the same time, you have to decide what is important about the school,
B:	you know, the size of it or,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I I know very few people that, uh, started in one field and stayed with it.
A:	You know, they,
A:	I think that's what you just said, you know, having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,
A:	I think that's much more important.
A:	I, I think I'd, I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school, though, that has a number of different types of programs, you know,
A:	that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer,
A:	but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, I guess around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so if the kid does change, they don't have to transfer,
A:	or they don't have to, uh, uh,
A:	I don't know, they don't have to give up years of, you know, of credit transfer and things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's disruptive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I normally,
A:	and, and parents hate to hear this, you know,
A:	because I, I actually teach college,
A:	I hate to, uh, I hate to talk to the parents
A:	because, um one of the reasons is because, you know, the kid doesn't know exactly what they want,
A:	and I always say make sure you major, in something that you like, even if it's not going to be your career vocation, because you'll get better grades.
A:	I, I think most employers would probably rather hire, you know, a, a three six in, um, in history, uh, to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Does that make sense?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I see what you're saying.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I always, you know, tell them that you should major in something you, you're going to get good grades in. Because that, that's always, I think, more important, you know, overall.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Uh, give me five minutes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, you, you're at the office now?
B:	Yeah.
A:	At work?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm just getting ready to go to lunch
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	that's like what we were saying, though,
B:	would you, uh, advise a private school, or a public school,
A:	I would, I would, it would,
B:	you know, what's the trade off there,
B:	what,
A:	I, I tell you,
A:	I live in Maryland,
A:	and the public schools here are, pretty good.
A:	I teach at a public school, actually,
A:	and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public a lot of the private schools.
A:	And, um, I actually, I would full time at a, at a public school,
A:	and then right now I'm teaching part time at a private school, at a Catholic institution.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, um and I really think, I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more,
A:	and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated,
A:	where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are public, are, are college educated,
A:	and I don't, I think because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, you know,
A:	they're not,
A:	it, it's the minimal cost.
A:	But I think you can get a good education at public or private
A:	but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,
A:	I
B:	Yeah.
A:	you have to really, you have to look around at the school.
A:	I, I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I think, uh, I would agree with that.
B:	In fact, the thing that, I'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, I was trying to choose .
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, a particular institution might be better for my area
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	yet, like, say, you know, the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Yet, if I go to U of I or C M U or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,
B:	but it's the same thing,
B:	there's, you know, what will the name recognition, get me, kind of thing.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	does it have a big ten football team
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	That's that's usually the basic criteria.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, uh, yeah,
A:	is it a PAC ten school, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I think,
A:	yeah,
A:	see, I'm, I'm at the University of Maryland, so in this, this region, um, though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland, my diploma will still say University of Maryland.
B:	Oh .
A:	Um, you know, it doesn't, doesn't differentiate on my diploma, though I would put it on my resume, what program I went to.
A:	But I, I think, you know, I'm actually at a smaller program,
A:	I'm not at the the big College Park campus, you know,
A:	that's the big one with the football team.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I, I think, um, I think you're right, that there's a lot of, there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition.
A:	Um, you know, when I first was applying for graduate schools, I applied to some big programs, you know, in this area, like Stevens Institute of Technology, which is recognized in the Northeast as, as, you know, one step below M I T in a sense, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so it's got big name recognition in this area, a big science school, no football team, but a big science school,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and technical people know that.
A:	But I
A:	yeah,
A:	I think you're right,
A:	you really have to think about that for the job.
A:	I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's,
A:	and when I,
A:	now, I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs,
A:	I was going to be a teacher,
A:	I was just a high school teacher,
A:	so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know, but then when I went, um, for graduate work, you know, or for a new job, people said to me, you know, Shippensburg State, where is that, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	And, you know, when I went into higher education, even at other universities, they weren't aware of it, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I think yeah,
A:	that's important,
A:	um, I think it depends on if you want to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,
A:	you need that first, job or so out of school, too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I guess another thing that concerns me is, uh, so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that job market talking to someone else in
B:	and, uh, um, where was I at?
B:	Oh, in going to school, you get taught the things you learn in school,
B:	but there is also a whole other dimension, I mean the growing up while you're going to school part.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, actually, in the Midwest especially, a lot of the schools have, like University of Missouri, will have a main campus like Columbia, which is big, multi disciplinary,
A:	Right.
B:	and they'll have a satellite campus in a, usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field.
B:	So you've really, uh, I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	depending on your technical areas.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I could see that.
A:	But, you know, at some of the large schools, I know that at, at, at University of Maryland where I am, you know, in a P H D program, I, I haven't even met, uh, someone outside of my area of information systems except for,
B:	Does your family normally have a reunion?
B:	Do you have one,
A:	Well,
B:	that's been,
A:	on my father's side we've really there, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	On my mother's side we've had several,
A:	not,  it's not really on a regular basis,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but usually sometimes every few summers.
A:	Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.
B:	Right.
A:	So they're pretty much just reunited always
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.
B:	Well, it might be a good time for you to to, to start a tradition.
A:	I know,
A:	that's
B:	You could be responsible for that yourself.
A:	do that,
A:	that's true.
B:	Sure.
A:	How about your family?
B:	Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual  uh, reunion.
A:	Wow,
A:	you're,  a pro at this.
B:	The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	And all of the descendants of the Civil War, I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together,
B:	and they come as far away from California,
B:	and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.
A:	And then where do you meet?
B:	Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas,
A:	Okay.
B:	and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you have relatives in Vernon then?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died
B:	and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.
A:	Oh.
B:	So we're talking about second and third great children here.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I take my boys well, I took them up until this year,
B:	they're grown and gone from home now
A:	Oh.
B:	so they, they take their family.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, let's see,
B:	that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather,
B:	okay,
B:	so it would be the second great grandchild.
B:	And so they,
A:	Okay,
A:	so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,
B:	Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall.
B:	It's,  a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,
A:	Okay.
B:	and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes.
B:	Every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,
B:	and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,  that have been handed,  down for years
A:	Potato salad and, uh,
B:	Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	And we choose to bring congealed salad.
B:	You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,  as opposed to potato salad.
A:	Right.
B:	And we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,  whatever you've got to carry for any distance.
A:	Right.
B:	I always, take home baked bread.
A:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	Uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family.
B:	I do other things very well,
A:	Right.
B:	but there are others in the family who do them better.
A:	Do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,  so that's what they get to cook.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	Well , I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions,
A:	so I learned a lot about them.
A:	I haven't,  been to a lot,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we talked,  a lot about the, the rituals,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you all equated the family reunions as,  with the Protestant.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was, it was an interesting theory.
A:	She talked about the, uh, the Catholics
A:	all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway,
A:	so you usually are living where your parents live
A:	and it's all,
A:	your, you don't have to come home,
A:	so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe,
A:	but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became their version of the pilgrimage.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But she had,
A:	it was interesting, you know,
A:	I don't know how valid it is,
A:	but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement.
A:	Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year?
A:	Is there kind of a, you know,
A:	salads go first and things like that?
B:	Well, it's, uh,
B:	we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,
A:	Right.
B:	and they plan the reunions,
B:	the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer.
B:	Uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.
A:	Well, that's pretty .
B:	We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,
B:	and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.
B:	And it keeps the family alive,  even, you know, even though it's very fluid.
A:	Sure does.
A:	That's wonderful.
B:	And they're very dedicated to that,
B:	and, uh, it's been really wonderful.
B:	It helps you hang onto your roots.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I wish we'd,
B:	And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.
B:	My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family.
B:	His family was very scattered and very diverse.
A:	Right.
B:	And I asked him, I got to talking to him,
B:	I said, well, how is his nephew doing.
B:	"Well, I don't know,
B:	I haven't,  talked to my brother in three years."
B:	I said , "Well, how's your brother doing?"
B:	"I don't know."
B:	Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think,
B:	but I don't.
A:	Right.
B:	I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"
B:	"Yeah,
B:	but I'm, you know,
B:	it's too much trouble."
B:	So I got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family. And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at Lake Tawakoni.
A:	Wow.
A:	You're just, uh,
A:	Oh, that's incredible.
B:	Liked to kill me, because I it was, I didn't have that group cooperation,
B:	I did,  it by myself.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes.
B:	We had a great big fish fry,
B:	and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.
A:	Right
B:	And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.
B:	And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them
B:	and I told him,
A:	Have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?
B:	We did it that year,
B:	and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.
B:	We sent invitations.
B:	We said, "Please let us know if you're coming."
B:	It was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,
A:	Oh.
B:	and it,
B:	his mother was alone, and so they came to support her,
B:	and then one by one, his you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,
A:	See, that's
A:	we've we had a problem with that.
B:	and it was difficult to hold them together.
B:	And then, of course, he died two years ago,
B:	so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, it,
B:	I think that's what happens when they get scattered,
B:	the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.
A:	Right.
A:	That's our, was our problem.
A:	We had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so it kind of wound down,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else
A:	so that,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive.
B:	They'll send out news bulletins.
B:	Two or three times a year you'll get a news
B:	hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature,
B:	or guess who our local sheriff,
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay,
B:	I,
B:	my children as a matter of fact, are all grown now.
B:	So, I am assisting them with their children in their selections,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	so.
A:	Great,
A:	well my children are grown,
A:	but they're teenagers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I have three children, um, fifteen, ages fifteen, seventeen and twenty
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, about, I guess about when the first, when the youngest one was in kindergarten I started working at a preschool and, uh, you know, doing some work,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I, I took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool,
A:	so so I am around, not a day care situation, but in the, you know, in the child care environment
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, um,
B:	Well, I, myself, really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment than the one on one care is.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, when my children were growing up, I actually had them, up and until they were in the preschool situation, I had them in a, in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids,
B:	and I felt like that home environment was very important to them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It was important to me
A:	Yes.
B:	and, uh I feel like that they, they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, it is.
B:	However in today's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups, simply because that's the way our young people are, are dealt with.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	in other words,  there're more people,
B:	They're dealt with,  in packages.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
A:	That's, that's an interesting point of view.
A:	I, uh, you know,
A:	seeing the children in the school the way I do, I, I mean, I see the ones that, we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program, that started at twelve months maybe, and were were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the, you know for the under three year olds
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but still they have an an opportunity to be with other children
B:	Absolutely,
A:	and it is true,
A:	and, uh, I, but I think that would, but as far as looking for a place, you know, I, the criteria, I mean, I think it's very important to have very caring people, you know to take care of the,
B:	Oh, absolutely
B:	without a doubt,
A:	in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers, you're going to need really,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I recently stopped by McDonalds,
B:	and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things, and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children,
B:	and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center,
B:	and of course, she was, she had just gotten her degree,
B:	and she was so enthusiastic,
B:	and she was excited about it
B:	and she was going to accomplish all of these things
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
B:	however, uh, when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time, the pay is minimal
A:	Yes,
A:	it is.
B:	and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment,
A:	Yes,
A:	that's right,
A:	that maybe,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that maybe have another salary in their family that, where they can do that,
B:	Absolutely,
A:	and that's what I had the opportunity of, you know, doing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and I could concentrate on the creativity, and, and you know, really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing,  them with a great atmosphere,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, they ask,  so much of those caretakers for the amount that, that they pay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They are to be there ahead of time, you know,
B:	they're there early to receive the kids,
A:	And they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning.
B:	That's right.
A:	which is,
A:	yeah,
B:	And then, then they have to work until the shop, until the place closes at six P M
B:	and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's true,
A:	that's true.
B:	And, uh, she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
B:	Uh, and she,
A:	because people can't pay to provide and,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	well ours is not, you know, ours is just, is a church,
A:	and so we, we don't have the, the expenses of a building, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we share the expense with the church,
A:	but we don't have enough
B:	Sure.
A:	you know, taking care of a whole building and that responsibility.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, it is, it is a lot different.
B:	Well, I know that when my youngsters were small,
B:	now my older son was adopted
B:	so he went into child care at two weeks
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	and, uh, my younger son went into child care at six weeks.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	So, they were in that environment actually, up until they became, uh, seven and nine.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And at that point I said, Look they have been given the custodial care that they need,
B:	and the after hours care has been as good a quality as I can provide for them.
B:	However, they're going out into the school environment now,
B:	they're under a lot of other influences.
B:	I need to be here for them.
B:	I need to be involved in their school, because I want to be the one who influences the way they develop.
A:	Yes,
B:	So I quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that I could help direct their, their learning experiences and their development.
A:	Oh, you did?
A:	Um.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I, I felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
B:	But when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that, that they're going to need to interact with other people, I felt like I needed some strong influence there.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I
A:	Well, that's different than most people do it.
A:	I mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school, you know.
B:	I know.
B:	That's right,
B:	once they get up in
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But, uh.
B:	Well, I just felt very strongly about that,
B:	and I, I did not work as a matter of fact,
B:	my son was in the second grade,
B:	and when he started, uh, at Skyline High School, I asked him, Son, when, uh, you know, where do I go to sign up for the P T A?
B:	And he said, Mom, don't do that to me,
B:	please don't do that to me.
B:	So I knew it was time to go back to work.
B:	But I feel very good about spending those years with my boys.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's true.
B:	Uh, and I was just really grateful I only had one bad child care experience.
B:	It was in a home.
B:	Uh, the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it.
B:	She was from, um, uh, uh, Argentina
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she was going back home,
B:	and I couldn't just, you know, wait for eight, three or four months and then bring them back to her
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I had to find a new place
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I put them in this home,
B:	the kids cried when I took them,
B:	the kids cried I could hear the kids crying when I went to pick them up
A:	Oh, dear,
B:	they were always cranky and irritable
A:	Oh, dear,
B:	so I just took off and went there one day,
B:	and, uh, the children were left unattended in a room, you know,
B:	they, they were not well cared for
A:	Oh, how awful,
B:	and, uh so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place
A:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, that's the only bad experience I had,
B:	the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I was very pleased with their development and their progress.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn,
B:	but they're going to learn it sometime,
B:	so but for the most part, they did have good care,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them,
B:	and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because I've always been, you know, been afraid of the water
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	Oh.
B:	however, my older son came home
B:	and he said, Mom, I don't like that man,
B:	said, he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me I had to get my face wet or I'd never swim
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	boy,
B:	it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them,
A:	Yes.
B:	and she said, Well, she said, you know, kids do exaggerate,
B:	but she said, let's go ahead and send him another day, or two days,
B:	and I promise you faithfully, I will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what's happening.
A:	Oh, good,
A:	Yes,
A:	Okay,
A:	so what were you saying?
B:	Do you work with, do you work around children when you work?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	not at all.
A:	I work with computers.
B:	With computers.
A:	Yep,
A:	they what,
B:	Okay,
B:	do you
A:	one thing I,
B:	but you have friends that have children.
A:	I have some friends that have children, uh, not that many actually.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh.
B:	What is child care like in New York?
B:	What is,
A:	I do not really know,
A:	excuse me,
A:	too much about child care in New York
B:	Does the company you work for have, child care on premises for, employees?
A:	Excuse me one second.
A:	Huh-uh
A:	No,
A:	not at all,
A:	in fact my situation is a little bit strange,
A:	I was, uh, a student for many years, and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile.
A:	And, I, have just come back and was doing consulting work.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, my.
A:	So I am just taking a little bit of time off right now.
B:	A sabbatical
A:	Uh, and, and I might,
B:	Well I hope you can stay as long as possible with it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well hopefully I can do some consulting work at home.
A:	And, if I can do that it will,
A:	Yeah,
B:	Oh yeah,
A:	I'll be able to spend the time with my daughter, and not have to worry too much about child care.
A:	But, uh, I might start to go crazy with it too.
B:	Right.
A:	It is a little,
A:	I miss the intellectual stimulation.
B:	Right.
A:	But at the same time I really, it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now.
A:	And,
B:	I think it does when, when they are real little
B:	and they are changing every day,
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	there's,
B:	and you just miss the little things,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, uh,
A:	Well, I think for me, the important concerns, I do not think I would put her in day care for joint , situation right now, unless it was like one other child with a, with a person.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I would not want her to be into a, in a large day care situation so young. Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
A:	Maybe if I needed to work part time, like four hours a day, I might do that, cause like, you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time.
A:	But, uh, I just think that, you know, when there's two year olds running around, the, whoever is taking care of, the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds.
B:	That's right.
A:	And only when the infant screams, are they going to go there,
B:	That's right.
A:	and if not, the infant is going to lay in the crib all day, and maybe have a mobile above it to play with.
B:	Right.
A:	And, you know, I play with her most of the time she is awake
A:	and I think that is so important.
B:	Right.
B:	Well that, it is important for the bonding that they do it, with the mother.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, such as things for learning gives the child stimulation I think is important.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Our oldest grandson, when he was eighteen months old went into a, a Montessori, day care system.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they took infants starting at six weeks,
B:	and they have a program, uh, in, that was devised by this montessori person
B:	and, uh, and a certain type of stimulations
B:	and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they, that they lay quietly and look at certain things
B:	they keep, deliberately keep the room not real bright.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and, uh, they have different things they will, they will put them down on the floor,
B:	and of course, they never have more than like five,
B:	and, and they will put them down on the floor
B:	and they will have I think one of them was a little mirror
B:	and some were just different objects that have, had a definite purpose for kids, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there's something about their eyes.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Uh,
A:	well she's, she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's, you know ,
B:	How old is she?
A:	She's two months now, nine weeks.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she's just started that like yesterday or the day before,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and so every days are different.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that, you know, I think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older,
A:	and I will probably be going back to work around January, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.
B:	Um.
B:	A little older .
A:	And so I think, you know, she will be at a,
A:	I have heard it's a rough age to put them into a,
B:	It is because that's when they are clinging to mama,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so you might have a real problem with that.
B:	I think it,  it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying,
A:	But, but I think it,
B:	so it, you know, it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We are just going to have, to see how things work out.
B:	But that's unusual.
A:	Uh, but I am trying to, you know, leave her a fair amount, even at this young age, with her grandparents, just to, go to a movie and things like that. So that she is used to other people taking care of her.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is it your parents or your husband's parents?
A:	My parents,
A:	my husband's parents are in France.
A:	So, it's a little bit harder
A:	but during, you know,
A:	she's met them already.
B:	Oh.
A:	Not that she will remember them,
A:	but she's met them.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	That's nice when, uh,
B:	I, my, I have three grandchildren,
B:	another one coming in September,
B:	and I,
B:	it would, if they were where I could not get my hands on them, I am afraid I would probably go crazy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I, I like that,
A:	Are they all nearby?
B:	but if, it you do not have to put them in child care, that's, that's an ideal situation for you, is to stay with them
B:	as,
B:	or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's, that's wonderful for the child.
B:	But,
A:	Well, if I work part time that might be doable.
B:	Right
B:	And you need to look at, when you, if you do decide to go with child care, you really need to, to look at what your options are and, and look at the, what they offer,
B:	drop in at times that are unexpected.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well,
B:	The,
A:	right now the situation is so tight at many places, that it's even hard to have a choice.
B:	Uh.
B:	Uh.
A:	Incredible,
A:	but you know, since this is,
A:	people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, you know, I just find that incredible.
A:	And my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very, very soon
A:	and she is intending to stay home with the baby.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, you know, maybe do some free lance type work at home.
A:	And so, if I go back to work on a part time basis, I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her. Because, her daughter again will be a couple of months, my daughter will be about six months older than hers.
B:	Oh, that would be wonderful.
A:	And,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it will be a little rough when she is a very, very little infant,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but like when she is a month or so, my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so, uh, she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day
A:	and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis. That I watch, their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever, or if she wants an afternoon off. Even if she wants an afternoon just to work. Uh, and not be bothered,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	we might be able to exchange that way.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so we will just have to see how things work out.
A:	But I think the whole, you know, ideally I think, uh, business should have the, day care centers there, whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids, or whether
B:	I do too.
A:	they hire a couple of people
A:	and, uh, you know, parents come down to supervise or, whatever.
B:	Really well trained people.
B:	Right,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and have, have some kind of real good program, set up so that you, when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid
A:	Yeah.
B:	or, and have some kind of program set up, like you say, to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner. And have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, uh, have, a, an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule, you know,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	that's real important to little kids.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well she's,
A:	my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet,
A:	and it's probably my fault, because I do not have a real schedule now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But,
B:	They, they adjust to what the parents
A:	Yeah,
A:	well she's been staying up late at night and, you know, sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know that works until they start school.
A:	Right.
B:	And that's a problem,
B:	society is geared to a, a day person
B:	and it's,
B:	I have another friend whose brother and his wife have done this,
B:	they stay up until all hours of the night.
A:	All right,
A:	why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next.
B:	I think our next car, I would like something like a, an economy car that gets really good mileage and, uh, one that's really reliable.
B:	I would, I think probably not a, a brand new car,
B:	but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra. Or something like that, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	something my husband,
A:	And, of course, it has to have air-conditioning
B:	Oh, absolutely,
B:	air-conditioning and a radio, uh, A M, F M and a cassette player
B:	and, uh, what else do I want
A:	Does it have to be a special color?
B:	Uh, I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice.
B:	You know, a, a navy blue or a,
A:	It sounds like something your husband would drive, right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, I don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one,
A:	but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts, of course,
A:	and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed
A:	and that was kind of iffy,
A:	but that made it better economically,
A:	so,
B:	I think that's something we might want, too, is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We'll probably have to look for another second car sometime
A:	and we'd look for about what you're looking for.
A:	but probably real cheap, too.
A:	It wouldn't be a used, used car,
A:	so, but, no
B:	I think we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that, uh, you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Would you like four doors
A:	or doesn't really matter.
B:	well probably, probably that would be a good idea,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes.
B:	That's right.
B:	So if we wanted it to take people out it's, that's a good thought.
B:	I,
B:	that hadn't crossed my mind.
A:	It would be fun just to win one, wouldn't it
B:	Yes,
B:	I would go for that.
A:	That would be great.
A:	All right,
A:	well, I think that's all that we need to say.
B:	Well, thank you for calling.
A:	All right,
A:	we'll talk to you later.
B:	All right.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Yeah,
A:	are you there?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you know the question for today?
B:	Uh, yes.
B:	It's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in ...
A:	And what is your feeling?
A:	Do you think this is vital important?
B:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you,
B:	Um, I think that, uh, it's kind of discouraging to, uh,
B:	I have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing,
B:	and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not,
B:	a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea, you know, even that there's an election
B:	or, and these are people that are registered.
A:	I, It, I have worked in some campaigns
A:	and it's the most discouraging thing in the world.
A:	I'm originally from Oklahoma,
A:	and up there if they miss three elections, then they have to reregister.
A:	And I have often wondered if, if maybe that would help the situation.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Well, that's a thought.
A:	Well, can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people?
B:	Huh
B:	I don't know
B:	I, I like that idea.
B:	Um, oh, I had a thought just a second ago
B:	but it slipped my mind.
A:	Oh, that's all right.
B:	Um, one thing that that I think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates.
B:	And I think sometimes, you know,
B:	that's one thing that I have learned in working in elections and things is, you know, sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like.
B:	I know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for
B:	and when they got in office it was just a disaster
A:	Well,
B:	Uh, and, and I'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them.
A:	I'm, I'm not
A:	the only thing is if they don't vote, they have no right to complain.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	It is, um,
A:	I don't know why we are so complacent,
A:	but I'm going to vote each time.
A:	Right or wrong I'm going to cast a ballot
A:	and then if I'm unhappy with it, I have the right to express my opinion.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, uh, there was something else I was going to,
A:	and I'm like you.
A:	I've just lost a train of thought that I had.
A:	But they have been more, little more effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it.
B:	Now if you just lose, if you just skip one election?
A:	No,
A:	three.
B:	Three.
A:	You have to you have to skip three.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, of course, those can be, they can be, oh, a long time apart
A:	but, um ...
B:	I think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it.
A:	Of course,
A:	what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting?
B:	No excuse.
B:	Uh, I'm not sure if I'm familiar with that, or not.
A:	Okay.
A:	I'm sure all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you don't have to be sick, out of town or anything.
A:	They, there is no excuse.
A:	Anyone can go and vote.
B:	Oh, I think that's great.
B:	Um,
A:	Do you?
B:	Actually, you know, my husband has run for office before
B:	and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because, you know, if you're going to be tied up that day, uh, campaigning or whatever it might be. Um, that kind of, just kind of takes that load off, you know,
B:	you can just go ahead and get that taken care of
B:	and ...
A:	But that is an excuse and that would, I could live with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But this idea of anyone
A:	I I am so bitterly opposed to this.
A:	If you're busy, that has always been a legitimate excuse. If you are incapacitated, ill health,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but to have the expense of,
A:	let's see.
A:	They have five, six people at my polling place.
A:	They can come from all over the city,
A:	and I don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this.
B:	Well, hopefully once they have, uh, you know, once they've checked them off the list
B:	they, they do have to check them off a list when they vote
A:	Yes,
A:	I know.
B:	so hopefully they couldn't.
A:	But is there, is every list checked as thoroughly as a,
A:	you know. We,
A:	back in,
A:	when I lived ...
A:	Well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to One that kind of comes up when you've lost it, the others, other subjects.
B:	No
A:	Um, as I was sitting there, I thought, the weather's been perfect.
A:	I don't know much to say about it.
A:	It's, uh, it's, you know,
A:	for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous.
B:	I'm from Plano also.
A:	Are you?
A:	It couldn't have been better.
B:	That's right.
A:	I mean, it didn't foul one launch,
A:	and that's kind of unusual,
A:	and it's kind of cold in the mornings
A:	so you dress up warm,
A:	but by,
B:	Right.
A:	That's the only thing wrong I can find with it.
B:	I just got back from Dayton.
B:	I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family
A:	Oh, how fun.
B:	and the trees are changing color there.
A:	I miss that,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, that,
B:	as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.
B:	Of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.
B:	It was real gray
A:	Yeah.
B:	but as soon as the plane got through the clouds
B:	and I saw all those trees,
B:	it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning,
B:	and the high was only fifty,
B:	and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon
A:	Ooh.
B:	so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies.
A:	I guess you have to take some things and leave some things.
B:	That's right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm from Utah area,
A:	and they, you know, they have tons of canyons where the leaves change
A:	and they're gorgeous
B:	Yeah.
A:	you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area.
B:	We did that when we lived up in Michigan.
B:	We went up to the upper peninsula,
B:	and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure.
B:	And then on leaf weekends it was, which is this time of the year, it's bumper to bumper traffic,
B:	people as
B:	whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves, because they had to keep watching the road.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's kind of hazardous for driving
B:	Yes.
A:	that's for sure.
A:	But I can't complain.
A:	I don't know if I've been spoiled.
A:	I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal.
A:	We've only lived here a couple of years.
B:	I think it is,
B:	and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on, at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and, uh, the first frost,
A:	Huh.
B:	everything just happened three weeks early this year.
A:	We'll have to see how it goes,
A:	a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal,
A:	but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week, or last week,
A:	so.
B:	Just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring.
A:	I don't have to live through many, any of those really,
A:	a bad,
A:	I mean, nothing comparable, I guess, to what you've had before.
B:	Well, I've only been here just a short time, too,
B:	so I haven't been through any of those either,
B:	so. I have in Michigan,
B:	but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow
B:	and life goes on.
A:	You're right.
B:	So, as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll call off schools and, and close businesses.
A:	Well, they get ice,
A:	and no one can drive on ice.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, we used to think they were pansies,
A:	but then when you decided what ice was
B:	Right,
B:	the real definition of ice
A:	So, well, I think we've discussed it good enough today.
B:	I think so.
A:	It was, It was good talking to you.
B:	It was nice talking with you.
A:	Maybe we'll get the next time.
B:	Okay.
A:	Take care.
B:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Hello
B:	Hello
A:	Hi.
B:	Hi.
A:	My name's Gail.
A:	I'm calling from Texas.
B:	I'm Sandy.
B:	I'm in Texas, too.
A:	Oh, what a deal.
A:	Took long enough to find you.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	seems like they take forever any more,
A:	but, um, so did you hear what the topic was
B:	Yes.
A:	did she tell you,
A:	okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Great,
A:	well, if you're ready, then, uh, I'll just go ahead and start.
B:	Okay,
A:	Okay,
A:	hold on
A:	Okay,
A:	well I guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Seems like, um, to me, everything is just changing so much that it's almost like, um, you can't keep up with things any more,
A:	and everything is, uh, everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women,
A:	I personally, I'm a stay home mom,
A:	and I like it the way it used to be.
B:	So am I.
A:	Are you,
B:	You know, I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,
B:	I mean, that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before,
B:	but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do, you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I mean I think sometimes some of the, the women's lib though, is kind of like they wanted it all, you know,
B:	and you can't have everything
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't think that you can have, I mean, there's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be
A:	Yeah.
B:	and to me that's more important.
A:	how many kids do you have?
B:	Two.
A:	Two?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Are they young,
A:	or,
B:	Five and two.
A:	Five and two.
A:	I have two,
A:	and mine are two and nine months,
A:	so, um, being, being home is real,
A:	I, I just am fortunate because I don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home,
A:	and, uh, I just, it's just weird that I was just talking to somebody this morning who's, who's a working, uh, lady, a working mom,
A:	and, you know, these people have secretaries and these high power jobs,
A:	and it just seems like, um,
A:	she, she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care,
A:	and, uh, I just think, I, I, I just don't agree with that.
A:	I think it should be that people should get back to staying home and, and being family, more family oriented than, than not.
A:	You know, it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other,
A:	and I hope it just doesn't get to where, you know, there's more women, more and more women going into the work force.
B:	Well, I agree,
B:	I mean, but, I, I hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work, too, saying, you know, you should stay home, you know, otherwise your children aren't going to, you know, turn out, or whatever because that's not fair to, you know, like the single moms that have to work,
A:	Yeah.
B:	or, if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I think it's got to be a personal choice,
B:	and, it's nice that, that we could have the choice to stay home.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I find that I, whenever I have to, whenever I'm in a group of people and we're discussing things,
A:	like just over the weekend I visited my family, and some cousins I hadn't seen in a long time,
A:	and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing,
A:	and, uh, you know, well, I had my baby with me,
A:	and I found that all I talked about was my baby, which was fine with me,
A:	but it's like, you know, here these people are,
A:	they're going to school, getting degrees, making all this money,
A:	and, you know, they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages, you know, like I, because I didn't have really all that much to talk about, uh, where career and things like that were concerned,
A:	and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes,
B:	Yeah.
A:	which is too bad, because, you know, I, I feel like I don't, obviously I don't get paid for my job,
A:	but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home
B:	Yeah
A:	that's what I figure,
A:	I'm worth a lot just for what I do every day,
A:	but, you know, I don't know,
A:	this is kind of a, um,
A:	at, at least here I've noticed,
A:	I'm not from here,
A:	I'm from Colorado,
A:	but I've really noticed that there are a lot of, uh, a lot more people that are more comfortable, at least, with some women being home and, at least in the circles I've travelled and in the church that I go to, you know,
A:	that
A:	men don't treat you like you don't know anything, generally speaking.
B:	Yeah
B:	Well, and I think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or, you know, even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff,
B:	and I think that's really important that, that they do that
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they realize there's a need for that,
B:	and, um, I don't know,
B:	I found when I did do some work when my son was young, it was like contract work,
B:	and it wasn't where I had to be there every day,
B:	but, I mean, we were going to the doctor once a week,
B:	so, I don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem,
A:	definitely.
A:	Well,
A:	Do you see anything wrong with public school systems?
B:	Well, yes,
B:	I do.
B:	Um, I think I'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to, to deal with in some quality way.
B:	I think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job.
A:	I agree.
B:	Do you?
B:	Do you have children in the public school system?
A:	Yes,
A:	and I taught for fourteen years before we moved to Texas,
B:	Is that right.
A:	and the, the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much
A:	I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,
A:	and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms for all the children
B:	You were a bookkeeper
B:	Oh.
A:	everything had to be documented,
A:	and I had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids,
A:	it was filled with documentation
B:	Oh, no.
A:	yes.
B:	Well, um, I'm, I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back,
B:	and, and I'm just really in a dilemma if that's what, you know,
B:	I love to work with children and to teach them,
A:	Me, too.
B:	but I'm really having questions if, if I can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, you know, what I do.
B:	I don't think, I don't think it's the teachers,
B:	I think it's the system
A:	I think so too.
B:	but, um.
A:	They're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,
A:	she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder
A:	and,
B:	What child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to
A:	That's right.
A:	I know.
B:	that's, that's true.
B:	Well, it's, it's hard on the children too,
B:	I think, you know, because the, um, the teachers are overworked
B:	and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best, you know, um.
A:	That's right.
A:	Do you have children in the system?
B:	I have two,
B:	I have, in the system
B:	one is in ninth grade
B:	and one is in seventh grade,
B:	and them,
B:	um, I'm home schooling my kindergartner this year.
A:	Oh.
B:	We, um, live in a district that has open classrooms,
B:	and I wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her.
A:	Yep.
A:	Are you in Plano?
B:	Yes.
A:	Yep,
A:	I am too.
B:	You too.
A:	And I have one in ninth grade at Clark
A:	and one at Hendrick this year,
A:	and he, my my, uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews,
A:	and the very first year I taught back in seventy-three, we had open classroom
A:	and it didn't work then
B:	Oh.
A:	and when we moved down here, I was just appalled that they were still doing it here,
B:	Still at it.
B:	Well the explanation I was, was given about, you know,
B:	they, they seemed to admit that it wasn't working,
B:	but they didn't have the money to restructure,
B:	but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, I mean, some kind of partitions you know,
A:	Partitions
A:	or just to face the children different directions or to do something
B:	Just,
B:	yeah.
A:	I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school
B:	Oh, goodness.
A:	so he spent all day in this one large open area,
B:	Oh.
A:	so, I didn't really care for that.
A:	It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here.
B:	Were they?
A:	That was our last tour, in Michigan.
B:	Well, we were from North, um, Carolina,
B:	and of course North, North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education.
B:	I think they rank about forty-ninth
A:	Oh.
B:	but our children got a very good education there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they were in the magnet school program,
B:	and a lot of their classes, from the time they were about third grade, they, they changed classes several times during the day, which has its pros and cons,
B:	but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	and it was wonderful
A:	Yes.
B:	so, you know, I'm coming to, to Plano thinking, Well, gosh, it's going to be really great,
B:	it's ranked so much better
A:	Yes,
A:	that's right.
A:	We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system.
B:	Isn't that interesting,
B:	I, I, I don't understand how they get this, this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
B:	I guess so.
A:	so.
B:	Well, my son is at Clark this year too,
B:	so, uh, we're
A:	As a freshman?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yep.
B:	And, uh, he's pleased with his classes.
B:	I, I, I don't guess I've been in the high school long enough to, to know what to expect really you know, how to judge it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	My daughter seems to be having a good time,
A:	she was absent with strep throat the last three days,
A:	and I ran over and picked up her report card,
A:	and she did very good,
A:	so and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect for a freshman to have.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	She's not bogged down,
A:	but yet she has some every night.
B:	Well, Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,
B:	so, that's interesting,
B:	but, he, his grades, I haven't seen them yet,
B:	but supposedly they're good,
B:	so,
A:	Yes,
A:	you always hear how good.
A:	Now my son's at, junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful
A:	but, who knows what he's going to bring home.
B:	That's right.
A:	Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time.
A:	Was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt?
B:	Yes,
B:	Yes,
A:	And it said that what, what do we, do we think that certain crimes should fit certain punishments,
A:	and, uh, I was thinking about it after I got off the phone, that, that I really, you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message to people, you know, about, um, child abuse and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that, uh,
A:	those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment.
A:	Too often I feel that people get off, uh, without,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree with you, although I will say,
B:	I'm not sure, you know,
B:	I sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have, you know, was, was because they were abused abused as children.
B:	And the parents are saying, Hey, wait a minute,
B:	we didn't do anything like that you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and, and I guess before I'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be a, an absolute certainty you know, like, uh, caught at it, or something
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right,
B:	you know, or if they, they, uh, you know, severely beat up on a child, or, you know, I would have absolutely no problem at all you know, with, with,
A:	Yeah,
B:	I don't buy the routine, oh they're just sick,
B:	or they were abused when they were little
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	well, you know, forget that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, sometimes they even wonder when, when, uh, criminals plead temporary insanity for, for for crimes that are so severe and then, you know, they get sent to a mental institution
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they play loony for a while,
A:	and then they're back out in public.
B:	Well, but I can't see that either.
B:	I don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent uh, you know reason to not use capital punishment.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, I agree,
A:	I agree,
A:	because we,
B:	I think, uh, I think if I wanted to badly enough, I could convince somebody, uh, I was crazy
B:	so, my family may say that on occasion,
B:	who knows
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, and too, you know, they can always be blaming the other person,
A:	well, she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child, or something, which I think is, unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	I guess, you know, a lot of,
A:	and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved
A:	and,
B:	That's the new one.
A:	Is that the new,
A:	I just happened to see the headline on it,
A:	and I didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what,
A:	but I thought, uh, you know, if these things, if children are being abused, I, I'm wondering how our school system is failing, that they're not even seeing this, you know,
A:	if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults, that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way, that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger,
A:	and that kind of, that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you know, to, to deal with that yet,
A:	but still.
B:	Well, you, you're right, uh,
B:	and yet, I mean, did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this?
A:	Never
B:	No,
A:	and I lived in California which I feel like California, you know,
A:	anything can go on in California.
B:	well, yes,
B:	I, but I was from conservative Wisconsin
B:	and, uh, you know, there was, there was, nothing on it,
B:	which makes me wonder, you know, if it's as, uh, prevalent as, as some of them claim.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It, uh, it, it, it's,
B:	you just don't know,
B:	and it all,
B:	unless they're caught in the act or the child is very badly, you know, beaten up, it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Now, Texas, is capital punishment for,
B:	it used to be just capital murder,
B:	and now they added mass murder.
B:	Are those the only two things that we, uh
A:	I really would have no idea. I, um, I don't, don't really know.
B:	uh, you know, because I have a feeling it is,
B:	and I, I think there ought to be more things added to it.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh,
A:	that would be pretty lenient in my opinion.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think that's, I, you know, uh,
B:	killing a child, or kidnapping, uh,
B:	and possibly not, well,
B:	I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt, you know,
B:	if they release them two hours later, he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, that,
A:	or like when, uh, I've heard when I,
A:	Okay,
A:	I'll just go with you first.
A:	What kind of eating out do you enjoy?
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, I like dining out.
B:	Of course, it means that I don't have to cook.
A:	Right
B:	But, um, I'm a divorced woman.
B:	I have one child
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, when, when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't particularly,
B:	I think it's sort of a waste of money to go real, to a real high priced restaurant.
A:	Do you go like home cooking, like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria?
B:	Um, Not really.
B:	We go more for the, uh, Chinese and Italian and stuff like that. Mexican, stuff that I can't cook
A:	Me too
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Mexican,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh, we do too.
A:	We do the same.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What are your favorite places?
B:	Um, well, I like Chinese food.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, there's a little place down on, what is that? Coit Road, um, Chinese Pavilion or something. That is really good
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like it.
B:	And, um, I do, I do like Chinese buffets.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, we go, we've gone to August Moon
A:	and we think that was real good
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but our favorite when you have a little more to spend, is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And those are excellent.
A:	They're really a nice place you could take someone to eat.
B:	Right.
A:	It's not the, the rinky Chinese decorations
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's a very elegant nice place to eat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We go, very, very often we go out for fajitas.
A:	That's
A:	my husband has just gotten stuck.
B:	Oh
A:	And we go to On the Border. And lots of places that have, uh, I think
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and some of those and get fajitas,
A:	and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then, uh, last weekend we went out for Italian also,
A:	and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, we went to El Sorrento.
B:	yeah,
B:	have you ever, um tried Pappasito's?
A:	It was fun.
A:	You know, what?
A:	This is, that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church
A:	and Bob pointed to it
A:	and he said, "I keep hearing good things about that place,
A:	we're going to have to go."
B:	Oh, it is delicious.
A:	That's what he,
A:	in fact, you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I guess we'll have to do it.
B:	It's,
B:	you always stand in line when you go
A:	That's what it, that's what
B:	but it's worth the wait.
A:	D MAGAZINE said that.
A:	It said there was always a line.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that's probably, I mean that's a good, that's a good sign.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And have you ever tried, um, the Macaroni Grill up on,
A:	Yes,
A:	we did.
A:	Now, my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and most of those things were a little more northern Italy.
B:	Right.
A:	And they like just the traditional.
A:	They're not very,
B:	they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type.
A:	Yes,
A:	they are.
A:	Exactly
A:	Exactly.
B:	Right.
A:	The place of the seventies
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	but my little girl likes, uh, Spaghetti Warehouse real well
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	most kids do.
B:	It's real entertaining for her.
A:	do you ever go for steak? Just a steak and potato and salad bar, that kind of thing.
B:	Um, not really.
B:	That's, a steak is something that I cook at home. You know, that you grill out
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I really don't particularly, um,
A:	Well, I'm, I'm real curious to try this one that has such commercials. The uh, that Del Lincoln
A:	and, oh, what is that guy's name?
A:	They do those real corny commercials.
B:	Huh.
A:	It's, uh, over, there's one over there in Addison.
A:	I can't remember his name.
A:	Anyhow it's some,
B:	Steak.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's some famous steak place over in Addison.
A:	There's a, there's a second one downtown,
A:	and they have these really corny radio commercials
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but but their steak is supposed to be wonderful.
A:	So, I I had not tried that.
A:	My husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it seems like I've been,
A:	we found those one time
A:	and then they discontinued.
A:	It was over in Addison.
B:	Huh.
A:	And then they, uh, closed up
B:	Yes.
A:	So most of these places are pretty much just, uh, theme restaurants around here.
B:	Right.
B:	I think that's what goes, you know, really goes right now in the, in the Dallas area.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course, you know, down, next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know, there's just a, there's a different class of restaurants up there that I can't even touch.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's exactly true
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's right.
B:	You know, it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there
A:	That's
A:	yeah,
A:	that's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um,
A:	I had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I haven't been.
A:	We usually don't go for beef really anymore.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Where,
A:	we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's, that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	when, when I go out, it's, it's normally to get, um, some specialty type of food
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	besides, you know, because chicken and steaks and everything I grill at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know.
A:	Well, I understand.
B:	And, and really it's, they're a lot better than what I get in the restaurant
A:	That's right,
A:	and save you some money too
B:	That's right.
A:	Well
B:	Saves you a little bit money.
A:	now what is your, what's your child's favorite place to eat?
B:	Um, favorite place,
B:	uh, she has a lot,
B:	Taco Bell
A:	Oh, yeah
A:	They're easy
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	Yeah
B:	That's right.
A:	Well, mine enjoy that too.
A:	They like to go pretty much where we like to go
A:	and they'll
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then our favorite thing on Fridays, we generally order pizza in
A:	so not Pizza Inn, but pizza to our house.
B:	Right.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So we've done.
A:	Well, um, is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it?
B:	No,
B:	not that I know of.
A:	I think we've, I think it's come to an eye conclusion
A:	so I'll talk with you later.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	thank you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Now we're ready.
A:	Do you have a personal computer?
B:	We have one.
A:	You do, in your home?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes, ma'am.
A:	I do not have one in my home.
A:	I use one all day at work,
A:	but I don't have one at home.
B:	Do you wish you,
A:	Do you find you use it a lot?
B:	I don't use it as much as my children and my husband do.
B:	My, actually my husband and I are taking a class at our local junior college called micro, micro computers one o one
B:	and we're just touching on data base, spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of, you know, different kinds of storage
B:	and we're just kind of touching on a basic computer.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	What kind do you have?
B:	We have an I B M compatible.
B:	It's a Gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that sounds interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What kind of a computer do you use at work?
A:	I have a, a P S one I B M type.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and I use it all day at work
A:	and I put all my personal stuff on it at work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I really don't, haven't had a need for one at home
A:	but probably if I didn't have access to one all the time at work, I'd want one at home.
B:	Right.
B:	I worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years. Which was different
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I didn't,
A:	What is that tracing, tracking the flights and things?
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Uh.
B:	How long are we supposed to talk on this?
A:	They tell us when we're through.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	okay.
B:	This is, This is my very first time.
A:	They come in and tell us.
A:	Have you just started doing this?
A:	Oh really?
B:	Yes.
A:	They'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now
A:	and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	It's not more than five
B:	Uh-oh.
A:	But, I'm going to ignore that.
A:	That's a call on my other line,
A:	so I'm just going to ignore it.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But,
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	That, I have that, too.
A:	It's kind of a hassle when you have this,
A:	but other times it.
B:	where do you work?
A:	I work at Texas Instruments.
B:	Oh, you do?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh, well, of course.
A:	I sure do.
B:	Of course.
B:	That's why you why you're making these calls, right?
A:	Well, no,
A:	I'm doing this at home.
A:	I'm already home for the day.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	Well, this is a pretty good deal.
A:	I do it, you know, I can't do it at work.
A:	I, I'm, I work in the legal department
A:	so I'm pretty busy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents.
A:	We use Word Perfect, Lotus.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	Oh, you do know Lotus, huh?
B:	Oh, that's great.
B:	That's something we want to learn.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's really,
A:	I love Lotus.
B:	Oh.
A:	I think that's about my favorite.
B:	I've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's great.
A:	It really is,
A:	and I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, you know, you learn something every time you use it.
B:	I have a question.
B:	On this, this thing that I'm, this survey or whatever, you know, this I volunteered for.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do I start calling in myself
B:	or do I wait for people to call me?
A:	You can,
A:	did they give you a number to call?
B:	Right,
B:	and eight hundred number.
A:	You can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you
A:	but you can only make one call a day.
B:	Oh, only one a day.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if you've talked to someone, like you're talking to me now and I place the call, this counts as your call.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh,
A:	So you cannot make a call now until tomorrow.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	Okay,
B:	so then, do you get the five bucks
B:	or do I?
A:	No,
A:	we both do.
B:	Oh, we both do.
B:	Well that's a,
A:	Didn't they ask you for your I D number when you answered?
B:	Right,
B:	I had to put that in.
A:	Okay
A:	so you both do.
B:	Well, that's a pretty good deal.
A:	From what I understand.
B:	So why, why are we doing this?
A:	It's for research.
B:	Actually, I'm doing this for somebody else but, you know, for a friend of mine.
A:	It's a research type project on uh, voice activated electronics, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	To, uh,
A:	it's, uh
B:	It's almost like that, Like a voice command computer type thing, oh.
A:	well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this.
A:	Now I don't know, I don't know everything about it
B:	Well, that's wonderful.
A:	but they, uh, try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this
A:	and that way they can check voice patterns.
B:	I see,
B:	different kinds of voices and things.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and get the computer where it recognizes voices.
B:	Wonderful.
A:	and, um, so,
B:	What about tuition and rent?
B:	Who takes care of that?
A:	Well, the thing is, is that I live in a dorm.
B:	Uh.
A:	So, uh, what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then the tuition is also the same thing.
A:	So, the thing is, is basically that I spend, like, maybe thirty-five, forty dollars every two weeks on, on groceries
A:	and that's about it.
A:	But the thing, uh, also is that, you know, like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something, then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars, um, you know, three times a week.
B:	No,
B:	you can't do that very often.
A:	So, I mean, it's,
A:	for, for us, you know, it's like, I, I can spend, I can spend that money
A:	but it's not, it's not what I want to spend it on, you know.
B:	Are, are you working anywhere while you are going to school?
A:	No.
B:	Okay.
A:	Because, um, they don't allow me to work since, uh, I'm a foreign student.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And so they, the government doesn't allow me to work.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so all the money comes from home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, you got to make, uh,
B:	so how do you keep track of where you are in, in your monthly spending?
A:	Well, the thing is, is that, um, I I basically know how much I have, right?
B:	Right.
A:	And so, the thing is, is that I, I can tell like, uh,
A:	I, I get all my money out of the teller.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call, you know, international.
B:	Where do you call to?
A:	Argentina.
B:	Argentina?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	And so the
A:	one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills.
B:	Yeah,
B:	talk too long.
A:	Well, that's,
A:	they, they want me to call down there every so often.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I told my dad, Dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often, you know,
A:	he goes, we want to keep in touch
A:	so I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so you call him collect?
A:	No.
A:	Because it is more expensive that way.
B:	What makes you , think so?
A:	Any, any, um,
A:	basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, because it's considered a luxury in other countries.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, you just call him direct
B:	and then,
A:	Right.
A:	Since it's his money anyway, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And he gets the, and you get the bill and send it to him?
A:	No.
A:	Um, I got money to pay that, too.
B:	Okay.
A:	So, it's basically, you know,
A:	it's like, it's not too much money,
A:	and it's not too little money,
A:	so I won't have to, you know, rush a letter to him or something,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because, um, he really wants me to concentrate on my studies.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What are you, what are you studying?
A:	I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering.
B:	And what do you think you'll do with that?
A:	With those degrees?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I can, I can work up, um, here up to a year.
B:	And?
A:	And hopefully get a job after that.
B:	You want to get into some kind of manufacturing,
B:	or what's the specialty that your looking for?
A:	Um, computer communications and data transmissions.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	so you want to find a, uh, data transmissions,
B:	you're looking for, uh, um, long distance type stuff.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, anywhere from, um, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, you know, all that,
A:	and so, well, you have a family, right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have a wife and two children
B:	and, um,
A:	And does, does your wife work?
B:	No.
B:	She doesn't work,
B:	she does, uh,
B:	well, it's kind of hard to say now days, um, other than taking care of the house, she does a lot of sewing herself.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And she gets paid for that
B:	so she brings some money in.
A:	Yeah.
B:	She is trying to start her own business where she does that full time. Alterations and sewing. Stuff for the public
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, do that on a, on a full time basis here in town.
A:	And so, and you have a monthly budget?
B:	Well, sort of.
B:	We're probably like most American families, I guess, that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month,
A:	Right.
B:	and we know what bills have to be paid,
B:	and, uh, we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with, with the monthly budget,
B:	so.
A:	So, you don't have any problem in, um, overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.
B:	Oh sure.
B:	We're like everybody else, you know,
B:	we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	You know, that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff.
A:	Well then, uh, see, uh, that's, that's one of the points which I don't see,
A:	like I, I don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas
A:	and I, you know, I don't I don't like to give any at all
B:	Yeah.
A:	because the thing is, is that, you know, it's like if I want something I'll, I'll ask somebody, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	like, like, uh, for uh, for Christmas my roommate goes, what do you want.
A:	And I said, I want a backpack.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You no,
A:	I told him if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's something that you can use.
A:	Right,
A:	because I, I needed a backpack.
A:	So, he gave me a backpack,
A:	and I, I knew he needed an alarm clock.
B:	Yeah. Utilitarian.
A:	So, I bought him an alarm clock.
A:	So, the thing was that, that,
A:	Right,
A:	but
B:	Necessary things , no frivolous gifts.
A:	right,
A:	but, um, the thing is, especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was, to me it was ridiculous,
A:	because you know, you have to,
A:	once a year you go out
A:	and you spend all this money on all these people,
A:	and some you don't care about, you know,
A:	it's like,
B:	That's true,
B:	why bother.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so, but the thing is, is, that, um.
B:	Well, especially being a college student your,
B:	I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that effects the budget especially around, uh, Christmas time
B:	at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What about when you have breaks like, um, Christmas or between sessions?
A:	Well, for example, we had spring break now,
A:	and I went skiing
A:	and I spent around like, maybe, two hundred dollars.
B:	I expect so.
A:	So, uh, but you know, its like, um.
B:	You've got to budget that though.
B:	You've got to save up in able to do that, right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I mean,
A:	Because it's like, you know, say, you know, it's like, we were saying, let's go eat out before spring break.
A:	I go, let's not go eat out, before spring break.
A:	Let's see how much money we have afterwards.
B:	Right, .
A:	And if I felt like I spent way to much then, um, I won't go out, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	and so, like my roommate went home,
A:	I went skiing in, over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything,
B:	Huh.
A:	but, um, but it was, you know, it was, I guess it was worth it,
B:	Sure it is,
B:	any time you can get away, and, and, get away from, from the daily grind.
A:	You know, it was a nice place.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	especially if you live on campus, and you don't have a car, you just go crazy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know the feeling.
A:	So, oh well, let's see how long have we been talking here
A:	six minutes and a half.
A:	Okay.
B:	Is that okay?
A:	Yeah.
B:	All right.
A:	All right.
A:	Well, nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you.
B:	Have a good time.
A:	All right.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	what do you like to cook?
B:	I like, well I like to cook foods I like to eat.
B:	I like to eat Italian food best.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I find that I, that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals, type things and, they're kind of convenient.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That would be good for a dinner party, that, you know, to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things, coming out at once.
B:	Right.
A:	Is that what you usually cook when you have a party.
B:	Um, I usually have parties that are smaller groups.
B:	I don't have, I've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so, um, yeah,
B:	I guess I usually do.
B:	I like to cook, um, heavy sauces, and, um, noodles and pasta and such.
A:	Really,
A:	that sounds good.
A:	Um, fattening
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually
B:	How about you,
B:	what do you like to, to cook?
A:	Uh, we,
A:	it's funny that, um, we're talking about this,
A:	we just had a dinner party
A:	and we had, um,
A:	our senior pastor and his wife came over.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I catered to their diet is the only thing, though,
A:	so it wasn't something I really wanted to make.
A:	I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with . you know, sausage,
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	because I'm from New Orleans originally.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, I was going to make that, red beans and rice with the, those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff,
A:	and, uh, well there's salad
A:	and then for desert I would, I really wanted to make, um, just brownies
A:	or French donuts would have been good,
A:	but it's real hard to make them.
A:	They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here,
A:	I don't know why.
B:	Oh really.
A:	I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have
A:	but,
B:	Humidity or something.
A:	um, that's what I want.
A:	That's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that
A:	but.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Kind of like the Italian,
A:	it's really good,
A:	but instead I catered to their diet
A:	so I made baked chicken in the crock pot
A:	and, um, it was good and everything,
A:	it had all the vegetables in it,
A:	but, it seemed kind of boring compared
B:	It kind of, uh, kind of down played compared to what you would like, huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Do you find yourself, um, with all the, um, cholesterol and, and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain?
A:	I find it changing the way that I eat, but not the way I entertain,
A:	because I guess, I guess I feel like if they're on a diet like that, I'm going to, you know, honor that,
A:	but if it's just
A:	another couple came, um, over a couple weeks later
A:	and I made,
A:	what did I make that night.
A:	I made a roast,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I made, um, uh,
A:	I can't believe this
A:	my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday.
B:	Oh no.
A:	I can't believe that.
A:	Anyway, but I asked,
A:	when Ricky and Carrie came over we made, um, a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And normally I, don't eat, we don't eat like that during the week because of the, you know, the calories and the fat in it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But you know, when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it.
A:	And I made blueberry cobbler
A:	and we had extra crust with it,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it was so fattening.
B:	That sounds good.
A:	But, I don't think we gained any weight from it
A:	so.
B:	Well, every once in a while I, I think I feel the same way.
B:	When I'm entertaining, I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really, really,
B:	like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories,
B:	so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play, sometimes.
A:	Right,
A:	I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over
A:	and she didn't eat it.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	But I did bake apples so that it would be, not brownies, you know.
A:	I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, um, I've read a good brownie recipe.
B:	Oh, that's good.
A:	But, uh, anyway, so I guess that's about what I did when I entertained.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, do you have anything else you want to say about it?
B:	Um, nothing comes to mind right off,
B:	so I guess not.
A:	Okay,
A:	well it was nice talking to you.
B:	Okay
B:	you too.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye, bye.
A:	All right, uh,
A:	I, I would like to talk about, just briefly What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context.
A:	I think it's, uh, refreshing to see the, uh, the support that the President got from the American people.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, we, I, I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed, uh, that, uh,
B:	seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like, uh, uh, President Carter and his thing with the, the hostage crisis, and he always did it through rhetoric.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And this time President Bush did it through action
B:	and he, he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support,
A:	Um.
A:	Yes.
B:	or, uh, I mean, he left almost no alternative.
A:	That's right
B:	And, and it was very interesting how he did it
B:	and, uh, I mean, I'm, I'm an Air Force Officer,
B:	so it, uh, it was interesting for me, uh, you know,
A:	Really.
B:	I'd certainly, uh,
B:	I, I mean I think it's great that all the support.
B:	I have, uh, friends of mine from the Air,
B:	I'm, I'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory,
A:	Right.
B:	but other guys here on base,
B:	this is a B fifty-two base where I work,
B:	so, we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it.
A:	That's great, um,
A:	if, if you remember, the vote in the Congress to authorize war, if necessary, was actually pretty close.
B:	Yes
B:	it was.
A:	And if, if my memory serves me right, I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it,
A:	it, it was,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm, I don't know the exact figure
B:	but I, I would imagine that because of the, how close the, the vote was I'm, uh, I mean almost certainly would have to be.
B:	Just based on the sheer numbers of, uh, the disparity of, excuse me, Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been, um.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, uh, I, I
B:	gosh this, uh, this whole thing now with all the, uh, all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're, uh, uh, they're in, in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election, anyway.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Especially the ones that came out and said, oh come on guys, let's talk about this little while longer.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean how many years are we going to wait
A:	and, and what, what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	I think that was,
B:	all those factors played a part in, you know, uh, the,
A:	No doubt.
B:	everyone was discussing whether we should, uh, wait longer,
B:	but, I, I, I know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer
B:	but I think we were genuinely concerned about how, their military capability
B:	and we, uh, I think we over estimated it,
B:	but still, we were really, highly concerned about it
A:	I think so too.
B:	and, that we were worried that they were getting dug in
B:	and, uh.
A:	Well they were, and in fact they were so well dug in that, uh, when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	they couldn't, yeah they couldn't,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's true
B:	they,
B:	Saddam thought he had the whole thing, uh, figured out to, to which way we were coming and which, what, what our doctrine was that, uh,
A:	Well, had, had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's true.
B:	That's interesting,
B:	I think, uh, this political situation over there now is, uh, uh,
B:	it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the, this opposition will, uh, uh,
B:	today the Turks, uh, agreed to support the Kurds, which is something they've never done before And, uh, this, *%
A:	Um, interesting.
B:	and the Israelis, uh, and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are, uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive for, to reconcile relations with the Israelis,
B:	so it's like
A:	Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel.
B:	Yeah
B:	I,
A:	And did you know John Sununu is, uh, half Arab?
B:	No, uh,
B:	I, I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago,
A:	Yeah.
B:	because I used to live in, uh, Massachusetts,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Right,
A:	in, in fact, when he was Governor of New Hampshire, I believe.
B:	Yeah,
B:	New Hampshire.
A:	Okay.
A:	I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back.
B:	Oh my gosh.
A:	And, uh, now he is a conservative,
A:	but he is not a conservative that favors Israel,
B:	Uh.
A:	and that, that concerns me greatly.
B:	Well, I don't,
B:	yeah,
B:	I'd certainly, uh, support Israel in, in their, their policy that in defending themselves and in, uh, in their handling of their foreign policy,
B:	I think, I think the stand they have, or, or the way the command respect, I, I support that.
B:	I think that is a, a positive thing for them after, um, uh, thousands of years,
B:	they have to, uh, they
B:	I think they in,
B:	when they became a country they more than, or, more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore,
B:	and, uh.
A:	Well, they didn't have much choice,
A:	they could either fight or die.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly, exactly
B:	and, uh, um, so, gee,
B:	I lost my train of thought here.
B:	But, uh, um, so, okay
B:	so I can't say whether that, that I'm pro Israel or anti Israel.
B:	I mean, I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region
B:	and looks uh, that the joining of forces for this, uh, uh, Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing.
A:	It is a positive thing, um,
A:	however, uh, every time an organization such as the P L O says well we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, uh, they get embarrassed some, every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.
B:	Right.
A:	And so you, you basically have, uh, mutually exclusive interests,
A:	either Israel is going to occupy the area,
A:	or the Arabs are going to occupy the area
A:	and I'm just not sure that, that there's going to be any easy permanent solution.
B:	Yeah,
B:	somebody's going to,
B:	and I think that's the problem the P L O has is that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate, or they're going to do something, they're going to try to make some peace, but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others, or they split,
B:	they end up being, becoming divisive themselves.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Uh, I,
B:	it's interesting,
A:	It is.
B:	I, I'm, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months,
B:	but, uh, that's,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	that, that is almost, I mean that's absolutely unprecedented
B:	that was, an, an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Exactly,
A:	exactly.
B:	And that, I mean that's never happened before,
A:	No.
B:	and I don't know if it will ever happen again
B:	but,
A:	May not.
A:	Well it's been fun, I enjoyed talking with you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay, uh,
B:	I guess, uh, well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time.
A:	You never know.
B:	All right.
A:	Bye, bye.
B:	Bye, bye.
A:	Hello.
B:	Hello there.
A:	Did I reach the Dallas area?
B:	I beg your pardon?
A:	Did I reach the Dallas area?
B:	No,
B:	you've reached Dayton, Ohio.
A:	Dayton, Ohio,
A:	I'm from North Carolina.
B:	Oh, you're from North Carolina.
B:	Where in North Carolina?
A:	In Raleigh.
B:	Raleigh,
B:	great.
A:	Yeah, My name is Fernando. *sd
B:	Well, my name's Mary.
B:	Fernando, glad to know you.
A:	So, um, do you, well,
A:	how'd you find out about this?
B:	Uh, I was visiting my son down in Dallas,
B:	and.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	he works for T I.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	but his wife has a contract with T I,
B:	and that's how we learned about it,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	because I'm down at N C State.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And so I took a class,
A:	and he said, sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes.
B:	Right
A:	So are you ready?
B:	I'm ready.
A:	Okay,
A:	let's get started. like a phone beeping
B:	All right,
B:	okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	so, uh, what do you think, that, uh,
A:	what do, what do, what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America?
B:	Oh, if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but what, what, what are the steps?
B:	Well, you have to see,
B:	I, the way I look at it, you have to think first of all why, *listen
B:	or has crime increased,
B:	and if so, why has crime increased?
A:	Well, see the problem is, is that, um, what happens is as, that you're, uh, you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people.
B:	Right.
A:	And so, as, as,
A:	and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,
A:	and they rush to get the same thing.
A:	They say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have,
A:	and the thing that we can do is, we need money for drugs,
A:	and what we have to do is, we have to go, uh, get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it.
B:	It's easy,
B:	you said the magic word there.
A:	Which one?
B:	Drugs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased.
A:	That's, uh, that's, uh, the main reason I think, uh, everywhere
A:	because, uh, you have deaths.
A:	I mean, I mean, you have murders
A:	and you have, you know, people stealing other people's stuff,
A:	and that's
A:	a lot of it has to do with drugs.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	It doesn't have to do,
A:	I mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,
A:	and like let's say you, you're, you're, you know, you're driving out
A:	and you're driving back home
A:	and it's late at night.
A:	And you stop by one of these, you know, twenty-four hour, you know, gas stations joints.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun.
A:	I mean, they're going to want the money,
A:	and you can tell by the people who are always caught, that these people are there to get money for drugs.
A:	I mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it.
B:	No,
B:	they don't want the money for food,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	and so.
B:	Well, but you know, the, the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,
B:	because, uh, I'm a retired educator.
A:	Okay
B:	And, in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started, and so on, and so on.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,
B:	and we're just really, uh, uh, now, trying to, uh, figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's a, there's a, uh, a song that I know which says, you know,
A:	it's like, in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America,
A:	and, uh, their figures, I think are too, so
A:	I mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, I mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself.
A:	What you're doing is, you, you know,
A:	it's like, you have other things, you know,
A:	you have the AIDS
A:	we're going to solve, try to solve the AIDS problem while, while, you know, some people are getting killed here and there
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then
B:	Yeah
B:	and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers, the big dealers in drugs, may be, may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But those people never get caught.
A:	The people that that, that I,
B:	That's right,
B:	they'll never get caught.
A:	see, their theory is that if I'm surrounded, and I'm going to be caught, I'm going to try to find my way through,
A:	and they're not going to take me alive.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.
B:	That's right.
B:	But they'll,
A:	You know, it's like,
A:	of course, I mean I might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,
A:	but you won't find me dealing in drugs,
A:	I mean, there's no connection between me and the people that were caught, you know.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right,
B:	and, they,
B:	one person doesn't know the other person down the line.
A:	Right.
B:	But the guy at the very top, the one who's, who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure, uh, the, uh, and had the political uh, pull to keep things from, uh, keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction, other than on the drug dealing,
A:	Yeah.
B:	because it sure is monstrous in this country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was, I was at a, at a party on Saturday,
A:	and this guy comes over,
A:	he goes, hey, how you doing,
A:	he started talking to me,
A:	and this guy was from Jamaica, right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he's got his little brother selling drugs in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, and he goes, yeah, I just came up here to work,
A:	and I go, oh you did, you make very good money up here.
A:	He goes, yeah, I make a lot, a lot of money,
A:	he goes, you know.
A:	And, uh, in the movie GOOD FELLOWS.
B:	Yeah,
B:	might. *spelling??
A:	Did you see it?
B:	Nope,
B:	I only heard about it.
A:	Okay,
A:	in one part, the guy goes out of jail,
A:	and within, uh, two months, he has all his house payments gone everything paid, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he had enough money to, you know,
A:	it's like, those guys, at one point, you know, they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it
B:	Yeah,
B:	really, you know,
B:	even in our prison systems they're finding that they're, they're having drugs smuggled into them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that, that was also in the movie.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So hello Mary.
B:	Been nice talking with you.
A:	We've been talking for five minutes?
B:	I beg your,
B:	we've been talking for a little bit.
B:	I appreciate the call.
B:	I enjoyed talking with you.
A:	All right, okay,
A:	same here.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Cindy, have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't.
B:	Have you?
A:	Oh, that is a wonderful movie.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it's not,
B:	the length isn't too long?
A:	No.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, we all heard different opinions about it.
A:	Oh goodness no.
A:	You don't even, you don't even realize it, you know.
B:	Uh,
A:	Really.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	one that, you know,
B:	yeah,
B:	it was too long
B:	and they thought that, you know, at certain points that it was going to end,
B:	and it didn't,
B:	and it kept going on
B:	and,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I thought it was great.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now, I've seen, you know, some different clips of it, um,
B:	and it, it looks good,
B:	it's just I haven't had the time to go to the movies lately
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	and I heard a story about there's a, there's a certain scene in the movie where there's, um, where they're, they're on a buffalo hunt.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they have a particular child actor, uh, who's, who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And when they were trying to film that, the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can't remember what they said his name was.
A:	But he has a fetish for Oreo cookies.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	oh
A:	And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies
B:	Hey,
B:	that'd work for me,
B:	let me tell you
A:	I thought that was really funny.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Now I've seen another clip of, um, the guy that plays in MURPHY BROWN,
B:	I don't know his name,
B:	but he played the, uh, the, the character in it that was very, like, gross, I mean, very dirty,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, I saw the one clip of him
B:	and ugh,
B:	it was first,
B:	I guess he was taking Kevin Costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That was rather, um, gross
A:	Yeah,
A:	the wagon, the wagon driver.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	But other than that I've heard the, the, you know, the, um, the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, the costuming *slash error yeah, was, *slash error
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	really.
A:	the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't, that, that, um, the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things.
B:	Oh really.
A:	And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age, to age the material
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	so, they, they did very authentic reproductions of the, of the actual stuff,
B:	The styles,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but they didn't, they didn't age it quite enough it seemed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it was a very good movie.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I guess I will have to see it then.
A:	What have you seen lately?
B:	Um, actually have been to the movies, um,
B:	I think the last movie I saw was MISERY.
A:	Oh, I didn't see that.
B:	Oh, very suspenseful.
A:	I don't, I don't like Stephen King.
B:	I really don't either,
B:	but I went with someone,
B:	and once I was there, I couldn't believe.
B:	I mean, it's an excellent movie.
A:	Really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I wasn't sure,
A:	because, uh, just generally, you know, that kind of scary stuff I, I just don't want to have anything to do with it.
B:	It's not necessarily, it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful.
B:	I mean it's not.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something, you know.
B:	No,
B:	in, in the book apparently she cuts his feet off,
B:	but in the movie she, she disables him, but not by cutting his feet.
A:	Um.
B:	Um, she, she breaks both of his ankles.
A:	Ugh.
B:	And that I couldn't watch,
B:	and, but, you know, you could tell when it was coming.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So yeah, um,
B:	that was so that he couldn't leave her,
B:	cause she,
A:	It still just seems a little twisted to me
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah Yeah, *b
A:	I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all.
B:	well, as far as that goes,
B:	yeah,
B:	I mean, you wouldn't like to see anything happen to anybody,
B:	but it was just how she got so caught up,
B:	her emotions
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, you know, and, and she feel madly in love with this writer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there was this,
B:	but she was a killer,
B:	and the, the character was, you know, prior to that had, had been someone that had killed other people
A:	Yeah.
B:	but no one knew that.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So. But.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately,
A:	I know,
A:	we don't see movies at the movies a lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The last,
A:	we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES
A:	and we went to see NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER,
A:	but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape,
A:	and then we rent them
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Now I want to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. yeah, *aa
A:	Oh, yeah
A:	that looks really good too.
B:	that looks good.
B:	And there were a couple others that I just haven't had the time.
A:	And SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
B:	Now see I.
A:	I'm, I'm intrigued by it,
A:	but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't think I want to see that either.
B:	I know,
B:	I don't think I could.
A:	I think, uh,
A:	well, now, we had some friends that went to see it
A:	and they said it was okay.
B:	Really.
A:	So, it might not be as,
A:	I think they may be playing up um, some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects.
B:	Really.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Now, we went to see the JAGGED EDGE.
B:	Oh, I liked that movie.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, it's, it seems like, you know, that kind of the thriller suspense and not, not real, um, strange in other ways.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh, um.
B:	Well, I guess that's about it.
B:	It was nice.
A:	Okay.
A:	Maybe we'll talk to you again.
B:	Okay,
B:	it was nice talking to you.
A:	Alright.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	let's see.
A:	I think, uh,
A:	I guess, if I call I'm supposed to start.
A:	I think, uh, that's the way everybody has done it so far.
B:	Okay.
A:	But, anyway I think that, um, we are paying a lot in taxes,
A:	but I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms, and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money.
A:	Um, we're probably one of the, the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have.
A:	The, you know,
A:	as far as the quality of the streets, the school systems, um, the hospital stuff that the government gives money to. Um, the, you know, all the things that the government does like that. I, uh, I think they need to manage it a little bit better,
A:	but I don't think, uh, anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks, because they've been messing it up for many years, now.
A:	So,
B:	I have to agree that *listen
A:	Yeah.
B:	And you're right.
B:	We, I mean, we, you know, we do have a good government.
B:	We do have a lot of things that, you know, that, you know, the taxes are there to support,
B:	but I do think they're mismanaged
B:	and I think that sometimes it's too easy of a, I don't know, to easy of an answer.
B:	It seems to say, I'll tax them if you can't get enough money, instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or, or, you know, get all of the waste out of the spending.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, I don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas,
B:	but, you know, it seems like we pay the state ,
B:	you know there's a,
B:	the taxes set by, you know, the state and the city can add theirs,
B:	and the county adds theirs,
B:	and, you know, we're paying almost eight percent sales tax, right now. Which seems to me nuts.
B:	I came from California
B:	and, you know, when I left there, we paid six cents on the dollar,
B:	and that was like one of the highest in the nation.
A:	Right.
A:	I think it's seven here.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Seven point something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Ourselves is seven point seven five.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Whole state.
A:	Yeah
B:	It drives me crazy.
B:	I'm thinking, you know, everybody is sitting here screaming about, we don't want a state income tax,
B:	but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up
B:	and they don't do anything about it. You know.
A:	Right.
A:	Where are you at?
A:	What state?
B:	I'm in Lubbock, Texas.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There's,
A:	we're still, we're still one of few that don't have the, uh, state tax .
B:	That's true.
B:	And I did pay state tax in California,
B:	but my goodness,
B:	that, that,
B:	the, what did you call it, the sales tax, is just getting outrageous to pay.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
B:	You don't sound like you're from Dallas.
B:	Where do you, do you come from originally
B:	Texas?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I do.
A:	I've lived in, in the Dallas area here since I was like four.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So. Uh, it's, I don't know, an urban area, I guess
A:	whatever.
A:	I don't know.
B:	You just, you just managed to escape the real Texan accent,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.
A:	No.
A:	No.
A:	I've just lived here,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I don't know,
A:	I do,
A:	I can think of all the biblical things about it, too.
A:	Where, what did they say to, uh,
A:	I can't think of the scripture.
A:	Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's. *listen
B:	That's right.
A:	So, you know, even, even in the story where they had to pay the taxes, the disciples, and, uh, Jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fisher, inside the fish.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I thought of those two things when I was, I was holding for a long time.
B:	Oh, were you really, trying to find someone at home?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, um, back then what they tried to do, you know,
B:	the would always try to stump Jesus, try to give him something that would contradict himself,
A:	Right.
B:	And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation.
B:	And, of course, that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's,
B:	you render unto God what is God's.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, you know, of course, there,
B:	I don't think they really cared about the answer,
A:	Right.
B:	they just wanted to try and catch him in something
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, but I believe in paying taxes
B:	and, I mean, yeah,
B:	like everybody else, I try to take as many deductions as I can,
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	you know, I don't want to pay more than I have to,
A:	Sure.
B:	And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons,
B:	but I believe that they're necessary.
A:	Right.
B:	So, I really do,
A:	Yeah
A:	are,
B:	Do you, do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	not really.
A:	I've, I spends a lot of time with our income tax, though. This, especially, this year and last year.
A:	Um, I have been married for just a few years,
A:	so I've had to really switch around from the E Z form to the, uh,
B:	Schedule A
A:	Right
B:	Well, yeah.
A:	All the deductions and all that.
B:	Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act, it seemed like it made everything harder?
A:	Yeah.
A:	It really did.
A:	I, I saw, that, too.
B:	I didn't notice anything simplified about it, except that they took away the deductions, the interest and, other things
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	We're looking at buying a house,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house.
B:	And it will help tremendously.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We bought ours five years ago
B:	and it's
B:	the one thing,
B:	it seems like you make those payments every month
B:	and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles.
A:	Right.
B:	So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There's a thing I just,
A:	I've been trying to learn as much as I can about it,
A:	if you pay,
A:	I know I get paid twice a month, every two weeks,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	that's once a month.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Well, I get twenty six paychecks, which would come out to be in thirteen months.
B:	That's right.
A:	So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks, Instead of once a month, you'll come out paying a, uh, one month extra every year.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	That's right.
A:	And it will, if have you a thirty year note, it will take like seven or plus years off of your note.
B:	That's right.
B:	My parents, uh, bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago,
B:	And they did that.
B:	They thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other Wednesday,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And that's exactly right.
B:	Everyone,
B:	though the note is thirty years, she said it's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years, or something like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Just because of exactly what you said,
A:	Right.
B:	You're making one more month's payment every year.
A:	And that's going on the principle,
A:	it doesn't pay any interest,
B:	Yeah. That's a good way to do it. *ba
A:	or, usually it doesn't.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And when we bought this house, we looked at doing a fifteen year note, because it added more to the payment, but not significant amounts, you know,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner.
A:	Right.
A:	That's what we're looking at, fifteen or maybe twenty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We're not going to go longer than twenty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, we're taking our time.
A:	We're going to try to make our decision by July.
B:	Well, that's good, though.
A:	Well, we just started two or three weeks ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we're not going to just kill ourselves
A:	just two or three houses a week at the most.
B:	Well, that's good, though.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Is it kind of a buyer's market down there?
A:	Absolutely.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Credit union has nine percent interest.
B:	That's pretty excellent.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So that's,
A:	I don't know,
A:	we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now.
B:	That's good.
A:	But, anyway. Well, um, I can't think of a whole lot more to say.
B:	Well, I can't either.
B:	I appreciate the call, though.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Me, too.
B:	I enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	same here.
A:	My wife, uh, she went to, uh, the school out there in Lubbock.
B:	In Lubbock?
A:	She was there for two or three years before we got married.
A:	I guess, before I even met her.
B:	is talking to child in Just a second.
A:	Okay.
B:	Go ahead.
A:	But anyway,
B:	So she was at school out here?
A:	She went to school there.
B:	Well, what was her name?
A:	Cathy Walker.
B:	No.
B:	I didn't know any Walker's.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, good luck in your house hunting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Thanks a lot.
A:	You, y'all work at T I?
B:	I do.
A:	You do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm in human resources.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's interesting.
A:	I work in the waiver .
B:	Do you really,
B:	because that's,
B:	I work with Elma.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I used to work,
B:	I, I did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	And then I have been in Human Resources for the last two years
B:	and I work with those same people all those nine years,
B:	so, I feel kind of part of the staff .
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm, uh, turning in a capital request right now,
B:	You are.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's funny that's where you're from.
B:	What are trying to get? *listen
A:	A machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers .
B:	Oh.
B:	Okay.
B:	So you work in back grind ?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm sort of an acting process engineer.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Not officially,
A:	but that's pretty much what I do.
B:	That's what you do, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And do you ?
A:	Right
A:	and .
B:	Well good deal.
B:	What did you think of Sam?
A:	Uh, oh, I like him,
A:	he's hard,
A:	but we needed that.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Yeah
A:	he's,
B:	He was very good for Lubbock when he came to, you know,
B:	it was the same kind of thing,
B:	he had a lot of good results.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's, that's what he said here.
B:	Good.
A:	He's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before.
B:	Well, good.
A:	That's been a real big plus.
B:	Good.
A:	He's broadened, our, um, the devices that we're making, too, which has made us as lot more stable.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Anyway, well, it was nice to talk to you.
B:	Well, you too,
B:	and,
A:	They're are going to interrupt us any minute now,
A:	I can tell.
B:	well, I know they will,
B:	and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	me, too.
B:	Well, have a good day.
A:	You, too.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	why do you think it, uh, sounds,
A:	do you think we should adopt it?
B:	No,
B:	I don't like metric system.
A:	You don't?
B:	I, I, I think the country is, is, uh, too ingrained in the inches and, and just the general, uh, background,
B:	the history of our country has been inches
B:	and I don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It, it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
B:	and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand, uh, you know, simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's, it's not in our national consciousness to do it.
B:	We've always measured things in the English system and, you know, everything, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	our land is in acres,
B:	our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I agree with you.
A:	I don't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system,
A:	I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the, the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America
B:	Yeah.
A:	and also the, uh,
A:	I don't know
A:	it seems almost like there's this, it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations
A:	because I think they, that's an area that the other nations, especially Europe, look down on us like oh, we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system, who haven't really attained it yet.
A:	And I feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us.
A:	And it's like, hey, we're content with this
A:	No,
A:	it's probably not as accurate,
A:	probably, you know, intellectually doesn't,
A:	it's not as sound intellectually, but, like you said I mean, come on.
A:	I had six years of college
A:	and I don't know the metric system and I don't care to learn it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm not some kind of an idiot,
A:	I just,
B:	And it's easy to
B:	we have a computer for just about everything now
B:	and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them, it can be done
A:	Yeah.
B:	because I'm a mechanical engineer
B:	and I've had to work when I was designing packages for people,
B:	I mean I had to, to work both systems back and forth
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it was not hard
B:	and you get, you can get a CAT CAM system that can take any design you want
B:	and you can push a button
B:	and it'll convert every measurement on there you know, from one system to the other in seconds.
A:	Right.
A:	There's a lot of people,
A:	like you're educated,
A:	I'm educated,
A:	my husband is,
A:	but, I mean, a lot of people are flat not educated
A:	and if I have a hard time, you know putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college
B:	Really.
A:	or I don't know how much of the you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all
B:	Absolutely.
A:	and if we can't take it and use it easily, well, how can you put that on, like, elderly people and you know, just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as, as much sharpness and mental acuity,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it's just,
B:	Or, or even have had the ability, you know, the chance to, to go to college or to, to to learn about,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think it's still good they do cover the system.
B:	I think it should still be taught in schools.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they do,
B:	I know now because I,
B:	even when I was in elementary school years ago they were, you know, we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various, you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements, things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and that's acceptable.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it failed, too,
A:	because like what you said of just, you know, hey this is ridiculous.
A:	The thing Americans have so much stress on them right now.
B:	Yeah
A:	I mean if you look at the average family it's, like, man, they barely have time to stop and get gas, much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this.
B:	Really
A:	It's like, I mean come on let's take the pressure,
B:	You know you need twenty gallons, but do you need how many liters
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's just like another thing
B:	Yeah.
A:	the American family doesn't need any more pressure.
A:	Just leave them alone,
A:	let them measure their drinking water in cups
A:	and leave them alone
B:	Yeah.
B:	And it, it just doesn't, it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life
B:	and the scientific community and places where it's needed you know, that's fine
A:	Yeah.
B:	and the rest of the world, I mean, we are,
B:	it's not,
B:	we may not be the top,
B:	I don't know if we're the top,
B:	we're one of the top superpowers of the world.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's,
B:	It may be arrogant,
B:	but I mean, let them come to us
B:	That's kind of the way I feel about it.
B:	We can convert,
A:	And, and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our, don't worry about it. And I think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak German. You know.
A:	Right,
A:	it is
A:	because it is another language,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, and, instead of saying the world speak German we found out that we can translate
B:	And that's what I think we ought to do with the metric system.
A:	That's funny.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	I think we kept it at real good.
B:	Okay.
A:	Is that all we need to say?
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's been nice talking to you.
A:	You, too.
A:	I think that was good.
B:	Okay.
A:	That was the best one.
A:	Usually I get distracted off the topic.
A:	You know what I mean.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we'll end up, one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania,
A:	and we were talking about something income tax or something.
B:	All right.
A:	And I just,
B:	Well, good talking to you.
A:	Anyway, I appreciate it.
A:	Have a good day.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right.
B:	Well, like I told you before, .
B:	And you're talking about credit cards.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We put ours up.
B:	I mean I had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up.
A:	Um, I wish I had.
B:	Well, you should try it.
A:	Well, I,
A:	it was done for me after a while.
A:	I had a, uh, I had a business going.
A:	And this was back in the eighties.
A:	I don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that.
A:	But, uh, I had a coin shop,
A:	and everything was going great while gold and silver was up,
A:	and it started falling.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards,
A:	and things got worse and worse,
A:	and finally, boom
B:	You lost your business?
A:	Yep.
B:	Oh, gol.
B:	What a nightmare
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was.
A:	I ended up going into you know,
A:	it was one of those things uh,
A:	Oh, it'll get better next week, you know.
A:	Things will pick up.
A:	And, so, there I was in old bankruptcy court.
B:	Well, you weren't charging gold and silver were you?
B:	You can't do that, can you?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, you can?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I was buying from other dealers,
A:	and, uh, you know, they take payment any way they can get it.
B:	Oh, that's a nightmare
A:	Yeah.
A:	Course on, on stuff that I was, on merchandise that I was buying on cards, it was, I was getting the money back,
A:	because I was selling it.
A:	I wasn't buying, you know, just to hold onto it.
A:	Uh, but it was things like, you know, rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	Well, I remember before I got married,
B:	you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	of course you fill them all out because you're honored.
A:	Sure.
B:	And, uh, I had stuff for like Sanger Harris,
B:	and, you know, it got up like to couple of hundred dollars,
B:	and I thought, Well that's okay, cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wasn't thinking a thing about it.
A:	That's the way they suck you in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I was just stupid,
B:	and every time they had a sale, there I was.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because, you know, got, get such good bargains.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I don't know.
A:	Well, just today in the mail I got, uh, I got, got my guaranteed acceptance by, uh, American Express.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	we've been getting those.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I went back to school and got my Master's,
B:	and they started sending those things to me again.
A:	Yeah,
A:	as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they did.
A:	And, uh, course, I guess, I guess I've been purged from their records.
A:	I used to have an American Express.
A:	Uh, back when I had my business I got one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they, they goofed up bad on my on my very first bill,
A:	because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the bill would come in,
A:	and I'd pay it.
A:	And the very first bill, I paid it,
A:	and then I got this nasty letter from them saying, You're overdue, pay.
A:	So I said, Well, it just crossed in the mail.
A:	So I didn't do anything about it.
A:	Two weeks later I get another letter, even nastier,
A:	and said, We're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay.
A:	And I looked at that,
A:	and I said, Uh-huh.
A:	So by this time my checks had come back from the bank.
A:	So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter, and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces, saying Thanks, but no thanks
B:	Um.
B:	Turned out they weren't cheeky.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they were, I tell you.
A:	They don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year.
B:	So what is it now?
A:	It's up to fifty-five on the gold card.
A:	It's eighty-five for the Optima.
A:	Or, I'm sorry no,
A:	no
B:	What do you mean fifty-five?
B:	You mean fifty-five dollars?
A:	Yeah,
A:	for the green card.
B:	But then, what's the interest?
A:	Well, now, that's the card, see.
B:	And interest is like eighteen or something.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	It's, um,
A:	well, of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in, so there isn't any.
A:	But on the Optima card it's,
A:	um, let's see, right now it's running at about.
A:	It's not too bad.
A:	It's actually, it's about sixteen and a half percent, which is pretty good, as far as credit cards go.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, credit cards.
A:	Well, they're dangerous.
B:	You know, my parents don't hardly use them.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Mine don't either,
A:	mine don't either.
A:	They, uh,
A:	my mom has a, uh, has a MasterCard and a Visa card,
A:	and that's it.
B:	I've got all my gas cards, because I don't want to carry money around.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'll do that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now I, I do use gas cards.
B:	Now Impact is kind of bad too, though.
A:	Yeah,
B:	You know. Especially if you get, forget to record those little suckers.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
A:	Plastic is just too easy,
A:	I mean that's the, that's the whole problem with it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um,
B:	Well, and you're tempted if you've got cash, a little bit of cash, and you don't have enough for the purchase, right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Of course, you got to charge it and keep your cash.
A:	Sure,
A:	naturally.
A:	That's,
A:	I got into all kinds of trouble doing that Having, having been out of the credit game for some years now, I've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it. *sd
B:	to someone in the What are you saying? to the
B:	Oh, my husband says I might buy it,
B:	but I, I don't really usually consider that an option.
B:	Maybe that's how we got in trouble.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but it's hard, isn't it?
A:	Well, it is,
A:	but, I, I, I'm kind of, uh, grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint.
B:	Well, it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
A:	I, I, uh, I just went out and got a new V C R yesterday with cash.
B:	With cash?
A:	And, it, it's,
B:	Do you work with T I?
B:	No.
A:	No,
A:	I wish I did.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you could have got a discount, couldn't you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I could use a discount.
A:	I have to wait for things to go on sale
B:	But there's always a sale.
A:	Yeah,
A:	especially on electronic goods
B:	Yeah.
A:	especially now.
B:	What is that thing I saw,
B:	Circuit, Circuit World or something.
A:	Circuit City.
B:	Circuit City.
B:	Have you been in there?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they're not, their prices aren't that terrific.
A:	They, they used to be,
A:	but they've gotten, they've got to pay for all that national advertising now.
B:	Oh, it's national?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think I've seen two around Dallas.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're, they're all over the country now.
B:	Well, what else ,
A:	They, they used to be good.
A:	I remember when they first opened up.
A:	They did have good bargains.
A:	I don't know if you have a place there called, uh,
A:	or you probably have something similar.
A:	We call it Service Merchandise.
B:	Yeah,
B:	in Garland.
A:	You got Service Merchandise.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go.
A:	And, uh, Circuit City came along
A:	and that was the place to go to get your T V and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that.
A:	And then after the years went by, they just sort of kept creeping up on price,
A:	and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now.
A:	So.
B:	So.
A:	So much for Circuit City.
B:	So. Okay,
B:	what else can we talk about?
B:	Who do you work for?
A:	I don't,
A:	I'm a graduate student.
A:	I'm a professional student.
B:	Sounds wonderful.
A:	It is.
B:	We were talking about that just today.
A:	It's great.
B:	We could be just lifelong students.
A:	It is great.
A:	I love it.
B:	Where are you going to school?
A:	N C State.
B:	What's that?
A:	Uh, North Carolina State.
B:	So you're on Spring Break?
A:	Not yet.
A:	Ours don't, ours doesn't start until, uh, next week.
B:	So where are you?
A:	Where am I?
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you mean, where?
A:	Oh,
A:	in Raleigh.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Little,
A:	the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh.
A:	What a dead place
B:	Is it?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've got a nice little business at home,
A:	and I sit around and tinker with that most of the time.
B:	So what are you getting your degree in?
A:	Um, uh, human factors.
B:	And what do you do with it?
A:	Not a thing
B:	Well, what is it?
A:	It's, it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them.
B:	So it's sociology.
A:	It's, well, it's more psychology and engineering.
A:	Uh,
A:	my, my master's is in industrial engineering.
B:	So you're working on your doctorate?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh lord.
A:	P H D in human factors.
B:	Oh, that will, that will sound wonderful, won't it?
A:	Well,
B:	Get you a little plaque.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I B M, uh,
A:	I mean, uh, a lot of people use human factors,
A:	folks,
A:	but I B M is what I'm looking at right now.
B:	Aren't, aren't they laying off several thousand people?
A:	They might be,
A:	but not at, not at the human factors level
A:	They, they're,
B:	Well, I heard it on the news today,
B:	I could swear it was I B M.
A:	No,
A:	as a matter of fact, the I B M right here, or in Carey, which is a little suburb of Raleigh, just, just hired one more human factors person.
B:	Um.
A:	Doggone it,
A:	if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been I'm, I'm, I'm going into or going into the, uh, dissertation this summer. *sd
B:	How much longer do you have?
B:	And get that done this summer?
A:	Uh, I'm going to start this summer.
A:	I probably won't finish it until the end of the year
B:	Ooh. *listen
A:	but, uh, I'm, I'm trying to get a, uh, intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in.
B:	Because you,
A:	It's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field.
B:	Why?
B:	There has been so much work done already?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's,
A:	that and, and, it's, it's limited application in some respects.
A:	Um, in the area that we're in here, there's a lot of places that use human factors people.
A:	Most,
A:	Hi.
B:	Hi, uh,
B:	as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, uh, took on a painting project in my bathroom
B:	and I had wallpaper up,
B:	I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that
B:	and it took me all weekend
B:	because, uh, the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls down
B:	and that had to dry.
B:	And then the spackling had to dry a day
B:	and then the painting took another day.
A:	You didn't try rewallpapering?
A:	You just, uh,
B:	No.
B:	I, I just painted.
A:	Did you use a textured paint
A:	or,
B:	Uh, no.
B:	Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth
B:	so, I just used a, like a semigloss.
A:	Um.
B:	And,
A:	Well, did you get good results?
B:	Well, no,
B:	not really.
B:	I need to,
B:	it, it looks so, bad you can see where those spackling marks were.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I need to, uh, either paper back over it or do something
A:	But it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't cover it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	It covered the spots pretty good
B:	but it didn't, excuse me, it didn't, uh, uh, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to.
A:	Well, we did a, uh,
A:	we moved, oh, last August
A:	and we're getting a house,
A:	my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den
A:	and we decided,
A:	we went to, I've forgotten , one of the paint stores
A:	and they just said, oh, you can get by,
A:	and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then you can just paint right over the dark.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, more or less.
A:	After about, uh, half dozen coats it looks reasonable
A:	but it kept,
A:	the, the dark
A:	it was, uh, just a real dark, uh, wood grain type paneling
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was smooth
A:	and, uh, and we would, we put this stuff on
A:	and, and it supposedly textured it or did something to it
A:	and, but because of the dark behind it, it was really hard to cover
A:	and like pages
B:	Was it like a primer?
A:	Yeah.
A:	It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got through I wished we hadn't done it
A:	because we were, you know, we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it
A:	and we were painting it and trying to do, uh, you know, make it,
A:	and it, it really was, you know,
A:	the advice they give you is, uh,
A:	the job was considerably tougher than we thought.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, particularly when you try to,
A:	I was talking to somebody else who, who had a lot of wood panelling
A:	and, uh, they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate
A:	and it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
A:	and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something.
B:	Oh, my goodness,
B:	that's an awful lot.
A:	Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?
B:	Not inside.
B:	Now, uh, when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it.
B:	That was one of the requirements from, you know, F H A that the house be painted before we bought it
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it was fairly reasonable.
B:	We have a brick house
B:	but all the trim around the house was, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	if I remember right, it was like five hundred dollars.
A:	Oh, that's quite reasonable.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	so that wasn't too bad.
A:	Um, problem
A:	have you, have you tried matching paint lately?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't.
A:	My wife,
A:	we, we built a shed over the long way ,
A:	actually, it took,
A:	this is not on the topic
A:	but I did finish it.
A:	But my wife went to the, uh, Home Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she wanted to paint the shed
A:	it's, it's a wooden shed, uh,
A:	and she took it
A:	and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they got,
A:	and, uh, and, in fact she put some right
A:	she got,
A:	they mixed, uh, a gallon of it
A:	and, uh, it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, uh,
A:	and it does it, uh, oh, electronically some, something,  magic.
B:	Oh,
B:	so,  they did do a good job?
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, they,
A:	but it's electronic.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, you put your sample under this thing
A:	and it looks at it and, uh, and determines the,
A:	and it, it's really remarkable.
A:	Uh, the problem they had
A:	and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, but they didn't, didn't occur to them that, um, that they could have taken a sample um, from,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I forgotten, *listen
A:	this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something
A:	but anyway. It's, it's remarkable.
A:	That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the, you know,
A:	you want this, you want this to look like this
A:	and you want that to look like that
A:	and, of course, if it's all white you're all right
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but when you start getting into colors,
A:	have you had problems getting colors to match?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	As a matter of fact, uh, what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a, uh, a blue
B:	and the blue, even so many years, two years later or so it doesn't match, you know,
A:	Um.
A:	So,
B:	it's the very same type of paint and everything,
A:	Gosh.
B:	So,
A:	So you,
A:	so what's your,
A:	what's the solution then?
B:	Oh, I have no idea.
B:	I repainted the whole thing.
A:	Oh, my
A:	Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	You could go back and, and paint, the whole thing over
B:	Yeah.
A:	that's, uh, this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting
A:	because it, uh, it seems like everybody has a, you know, to go in and do,
A:	I'll just do a little bit here and a little there .
B:	Yeah.
A:	Although, the, uh,
A:	it's uh, it,
A:	we almost one day,
A:	we painted the house to, uh,
A:	we painted, we painted the whole inside
A:	and it had all this dark trim.
A:	We thought, uh, you know,
A:	we did the one wall but the other trim,
A:	I'm trying to think,
A:	I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, uh,
A:	they don't do that in the newer houses now
A:	we don't,
B:	Yeah.
A:	the mold , everything is white .
A:	In a new house everything is white.
B:	White,
B:	yeah.
B:	That's what we're trying to get ours to look like.
A:	Oh, good luck
A:	We wound up selling the house.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Actually, I, I don't know whether it made,
A:	actually it does,
A:	it's interesting that the white, um, makes the rooms look bigger.
A:	One of the,
A:	in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room, it has molding, uh, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that that actually, that are along the walls, you know, up a couple of feet.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And my wife painted those, the insides of those dark blue.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, uh, it makes the room look remarkably smaller.
B:	Huh. She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim, what color ?
A:	The trim, is still white.
B:	Okay.
A:	The, the molding
B:	White.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but by,
A:	and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it makes the room look smaller which is, uh uh, which is,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it explains why they, why they have everything white
A:	but I, you wouldn't think that I,
B:	Yeah.
A:	well, maybe, maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff
B:	Yeah.
A:	but,
B:	Well, uh, what about the lighting?
B:	Did it make a big difference?
A:	Uh, not particularly
A:	because the house has so many windows
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	uh, it has
A:	the, the, the living room has four, uh, good size windows
A:	and, uh, well, of course, at night
A:	but with the,
A:	we have, we have a soccer field that's, um, oh, about a hundred yards from our house
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the lights shine right at our house.
A:	It's kind of,
A:	we didn't know that when we bought the house
A:	but,
B:	So that, uh,
B:	you get some,
B:	the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We have a lot of light,
A:	yeah.
A:	And, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's just, uh, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet
A:	and then above that we left it white
A:	so. Anyway, it didn't, it didn't change
B:	I see .
A:	but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away
A:	it didn't,
A:	it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're we're really on to that, that the masking is,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you have to do that very, very carefully.
B:	And it takes a long time,
A:	That's right.
A:	You can work yourself to death.
A:	Well, I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Really,
B:	no kidding.
A:	It's kind of frustrating.
B:	It is.
B:	A lot of work,
B:	a lot of work.
A:	Well, I've got to go to a meeting.
A:	It's been good talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Okay.
A:	Good-bye.
B:	Bye sounds in
A:	Well I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type
B:	Have you been talking to males?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female
A:	I was afraid we might get into an argument.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, uh, I guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and uh, I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now, And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner, than before.
A:	Oh, I think so.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	I, I, I think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sometimes, I think I am going crazy trying to do it
A:	but,
B:	Do you work outside the home?
A:	Yes.
B:	Do you have children?
A:	Uh, yes.
A:	They are getting older now,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they are not quite as much of a responsibility
A:	but they are still there, you know,
B:	Oh sure.
A:	they still take time,
A:	and, and I, you know, I still provide most of the things that go on around the house.
B:	Right.
A:	So, uh, yeah
A:	and for a while I was going to school too,
A:	and it was tough.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I uh, I think that while it's a good change for I think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, you know, their expertise may be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I think sometimes other things suffer and
B:	I think it's hard to find a balance there.
A:	But in some ways I think we are expected to do it all.
A:	You're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things
A:	and that's where the problem is really.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I have little children, four and one,
B:	and I decided that it was very important to me to stay home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and when I, I, I happen to, you know be,
B:	I'm very active with, uh, people, other people with children my age
B:	and most of us do tend to stay home,
B:	but when I run into people that, you know, just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time, I, there's almost a, uh, friction between us.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	not people that are, you know, necessarily good friends, Even though that has happened too, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence.
B:	You know
B:	if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself.
A:	Right.
B:	And if you don't then, sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time , at home.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a tough one.
A:	I mean, I've done some of both.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, when my kids were real little, I was at home for a couple of different periods of time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I think the longest was less than a year,
A:	but still at least I was able to, to spend, you know, those first months with them.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, the money was the issue.
A:	But, uh, even now, I would, I would like to not have to work in some ways.
B:	Right.
A:	It, it's kind of pull and tug,
B:	Yeah.
A:	on the other hand, I can't imagine just being at home, uh, although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, still, uh, there's, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having, you know, a job and all that goes with that.
B:	No,
B:	that, that's definitely true.
B:	In fact, I, I work out of my home.
B:	Um, I'm an accountant,
A:	Oh.
B:	and I do taxes and bookkeeping
B:	and I, uh,
B:	it was,
B:	it's a way for me to stay home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I mean, I still, unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, but it, it's worked out for, for my family, to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good deal.
A:	Where do you think this is going in the future,
A:	I mean, do you think things are going to change,
A:	or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this?
B:	Well, I, I hope that they will change uh,
B:	but, but I'm,
B:	I just,
B:	I know it's going to be a slow change.
B:	Uh, I, I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner.
B:	I mean I'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know.
B:	I know quite a few people who have decided to not have both, both, both, uh, couples, you know, both, uh, of the parents work.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And yet, uh, I, I
B:	I hope to see employer based, you know, helping out. You know, child, uh, care centers at the place of employment and, and things like that, that will help out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you think,
B:	do you think we are, setting a trend?
A:	I don't,
A:	yeah,
A:	I, well I see, I think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the, the family things work.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, but I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers, you know.
A:	It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are,
A:	I don't know if they want to completely give that up.
B:	Right,
B:	it's a very personal thing.
A:	But, it would be nice if there could be an in-between, a middle ground somewhere.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think it's hard though when you talk about, about families and, and raising children
B:	because I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground.
B:	I think they, uh, they need security
B:	and yet they,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I,
B:	from speaking from my children, they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They, uh, they want to know things are going to be a certain way.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I think they, they like a routine of sorts.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
B:	Well, we will see.
B:	I, I'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society.
A:	Well, yes,
A:	I, I like the fact that, you know, gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions,
A:	but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	the, the numbers are still very skewed to say the least.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	well I enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Okay,
B:	you too Ellen.
A:	All right,
A:	good-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Okay,
B:	what do you usually wear to work?
A:	Well, uh, I am basically retired now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was a member,
A:	I was in education and in administration, And, uh, heels,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I was never one, uh, because my work often took me into court, uh, never was one that got, uh, accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that was just me.
A:	I know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants.
A:	Uh, it,
A:	I guess I was just old enough not to, uh, be very comfortable in it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, I work at T I
B:	and they don't really have, uh, dress code, so to speak there.
B:	It's pretty lax about, um, you know,
B:	you can pretty much wear whatever you want to,
B:	and I wear anything from jeans, when I'm feeling really casual to, uh, suits and dresses when I'm meeting with a customer and so when I'm teaching a class, obviously I wear a suit or dress, *sd It, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what I'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and when it's raining, I'm more likely to wear jeans
B:	and, and when it's really cold I'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, but it just really depends on the weather and my mood
B:	and then, you know, obviously when I'm doing anything that I'm in front of people, or, or making presentations, teaching, whatever. I'm going to dress up more
A:	Yes.
A:	And I think that does make a difference,
A:	because when you do have to be in front of people, uh, I think you, the, the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and, and, uh, more classical style of clothing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What about the mini skirt?
B:	There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work.
B:	There pretty strict about that, though.
B:	Um, I've never worn,
B:	I just wouldn't,
B:	I mean even to,
B:	well jeans aren't exactly professional
B:	but, for some reason a mini skirt is, to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans
B:	just because it's, maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything
B:	but you just feel like you're, you're being, showing too much
B:	I don't know,
B:	I wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work.
B:	I have seen a few people do it though,
B:	but they, they weren't overly
B:	and they weren't overly revealing.
B:	They were pretty much in good taste,
B:	but, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	for me I just, I just, wouldn't want to do that.
A:	Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts.
B:	Yeah.
A:	There are some that are really short
A:	and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's what I've seen.
A:	and again it depends upon the size, the shape of the person, as well as the shape of the person's legs.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, I also, uh,
A:	even though I retired from education, I, uh, I do modeling
A:	and I teach at a modeling agency here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so, when we are doing wardrobing and we have, uh, two, two hour classes in wardrobe, we do discuss a great deal, the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through, uh, grandmothers, in my class.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I always try to emphasize the, clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because maybe they, those are not the clothes that are the most, uh, appealing to you, or the most, uh, complimentary to you.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want.
B:	Right
A:	And, and then, uh, then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well I feel like too, on the job, when, you know, there's men around and some of the managers are men, you just, you know, you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, uh, to me I just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Well, I, I, uh, I have to, uh, agree with that, even when they was very, very popular in the early sixties,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I, uh, uh,
A:	again maybe because I was at the school, there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, we had no regulation against it
A:	and a lot of the kids did of course,
A:	and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers.
B:	Right
A:	Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts.
B:	Right.
A:	And so, I think, uh, uh, of course, now I go the other extreme, I do not like to see, in the corporate areas, uh, all the women dressed like men, with the suits and, uh, white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I don't like that,
A:	I don't,
A:	I think there should be individuality in dressing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even with the very tailored look of a suit, sometimes I like to have a just a little something that's feminine.
A:	Yes.
B:	Not, you know,
B:	you don't want to over do it but, just a little, a touch of it just to say, yes, I am a woman,
A:	Right.
B:	but I can be professional too.
A:	Well, I, and I don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to, to look professional.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I think that you, you make of that what you wish
A:	and you can go the opposite direction and, uh, over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you, which don't belong in the, in, at least in my opinion, in the work place,
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, but that, that
A:	you can have a classical look without a lot of, a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because that was one thing I always fought against.
A:	I started out as a physical education teacher.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish,
B:	Right.
A:	uh, and people would never, ever guess that I was Phys Ed
A:	and, um, and that pleased me,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, and so, then I, of course, just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work
A:	and, uh, and I find even, even at home here now, I, I will wear blue jeans or I'll wear shorts and what have you, uh, and be very comfortable
A:	but when I go out somewhere, then, uh, unless I have a pair of dress slacks, I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And, so, uh, uh, I just feel that, uh, you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, there are certain norms that companies should be able to, uh, put out as guidelines for their employees.
B:	Right,
B:	that's what I, one thing I like about T I is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear
B:	and they don't, you know, your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember, tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit.
B:	I mean, they, they leave it up to you and your judgment to, to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have.
A:	Right.
A:	Yes.
B:	The only real restrictions they have are, uh, no halter tops and no shorts, even the long walking short of the squirts, the, the split skirts, anything that, that could be considered shorts they don't allow.
A:	Yes.
A:	That's good.
B:	And they don't allow, uh, any sweat, any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,
B:	but, other than that, it's pretty, pretty lax
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual
B:	and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day.
A:	Yes.
B:	Or, you know, if you want to be comfortable and casual you can, Whereas, uh, sometimes when your in the suit and feel, kind of almost stiff and you're not, you know, maybe you don't, uh, can't get as comfortable to sit down *sv
A:	Right.
B:	and, you know, like when I'm writing training material, I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So, that's I think, that is good that they're like that.
B:	I do know there's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear
B:	and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and, you know, no variation,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I don't, I don't quite agree with that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I don't either.
A:	Fortunately I don't have to work in those companies
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, I, I, uh, did have a group come over from one of the banks, over the children's hospital where I was volunteering
A:	and, uh, they were doing a presentation
A:	and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like, men and women.
A:	They all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie. And one was a skirt and one was a pant. *sd
B:	Uh, right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, and I think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That 's, uh, can stifle creativity.
B:	Right,
B:	I agree.
A:	So.
B:	Well, it,
B:	I guess we've talked probably long enough.
A:	I guess so,
A:	well it's been nice talking with you.
B:	Nice talking to you too,
B:	I enjoyed it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	bye, bye.
B:	Bye, bye.
B:	Okay.
A:	like a All right.
A:	What have you seen?
B:	The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES.
A:	That's,
A:	I knew you were going to say that.
A:	I wanted, I want  to go see that.
B:	Oh, man.
B:	like water I, I just finally ended up going to see it, uh,
B:	and one day my husband had the kids
B:	and I just went because we couldn't, we could never get to go see it together because it's so long.
B:	By the time we had a babysitter for that long.
A:	Gosh.
B:	So I finally just went to see it.
B:	And I just thought it was fantastic.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, I watched, uh, Costner on the Academy Awards.
A:	I was really happy that he got,
A:	I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but he, he, he did pretty good on that one.
B:	That was quite a, like ping
B:	the buffalo scene in that thing  was so real.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's like,
B:	I mean it just  blew me away.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'd, I bet.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see.
A:	Uh,  DANCES. Uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I'm, I'm afraid to go see that one.
B:	That one looks so scary just,  from the previews.
B:	I thought gosh  I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months
A:	Nay.
B:	It's supposed to  be good though.
A:	Nay.
A:	That's what people said,
B:	I know some friends who went to see it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They said it was really riveting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, you know, they, they, that's what they said about THE EXORCIST, you know.
A:	No, no,
A:	it's terrible.
A:	You'll have nightmares, you know.
A:	I watched last weekend.
A:	Me and my roommate.
A:	We, we laughed about it
B:	Well, you're not a thirteen year old.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I saw it when I was a kid
B:	and I thought, oh, man
A:	Well, I'll tell,
A:	well I guess, I, I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	Huh. Gosh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	He's a very good writer
A:	and he had a way of putting you in that scene, you know.
A:	It was,
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, of course, I was, I was living alone at the time
A:	and it was late at night and scary and, you know
A:	You start hearing noises  you know.
B:	Gosh.
B:	Call the crisis line.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I bet.
A:	And there's rats in the attic, you know.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Uh, let's see.
A:	There was a couple of others that are out,
A:	and I can't remember,
B:	I saw one I thought was crummy.
B:	With that new, uh, Michael J Fox movie, THE HARD WAY.
B:	Where he plays a, a actor that's, uh, like huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I didn't, I didn't even like the previews on that.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	It was,
B:	well I ended up at the theater
B:	and there was, didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see,
B:	so I'll try that.
B:	But it wasn't worth anything.
B:	I didn't care  for that at all.
A:	No.
A:	I, I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART THREE deals
B:	and that was crummy also.
B:	I  didn't think that was any good
A:	Yeah.
B:	so
A:	I saw the original BACK TO THE FUTURE
A:	and then I, I know,
A:	I hardly ever go see a sequel.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I think, I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	Uh, TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book.
B:	Well, I hadn't read it
B:	and I couldn't figure what was going on half the time,
B:	so
A:	Yeah.
A:	No,
A:	nobody could figure it out.
A:	I mean  the, the book was so much, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	there's just things,
A:	all you can do is put it in words.
A:	You can't put it in pictures.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film, you say what is this?
A:	You know, what's the significance of the apes, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I should probably go back and read the book now that I just saw the movie again not too long ago.
A:	Oh, the book is really good.
A:	I mean, I, I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again
A:	and that's one of them.
B:	Wow. Huh.
A:	It's, it's so well written.
B:	Huh. Well, I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids. OTIS AND MILO.
A:	Oh, you're right.
A:	I haven't
B:	Oh, that is, that is the most precious movie.
B:	It has, to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life.
B:	And it's all this,
B:	it's the story of this little cat and dog
B:	and it's not like cutesy.
B:	It's just, uh, it's just so realistic. Everything they do.
B:	You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things.
A:	Huh. Oh, those
B:	And it was,  A real dog and  cat
A:	a real dog and cat?
A:	Huh.
B:	and all the other animals.
B:	They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised.
B:	And then the cat gets, um, on this treacherous journey.
B:	He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river
B:	and he winds up all over creation.
B:	I don't know where in the world it is.
B:	Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed.
A:	Huh.
B:	But, uh, it's just really an incredible thing.
A:	sounds sort of like the incredible journey.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It was pretty wild
B:	and . Of course, the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But there's no, you know, nothing else to keep it going.
B:	But it really keeps keeps me going.
A:	Huh.
B:	I, I've seen it twice now
A:	Yeah.
A:	that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film.
B:	Huh?
A:	Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones.
B:	Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Not anymore.
A:	I mean, I, I, I was raised on Walt Disney films. You know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	OLD YELLER. Uh, BIG RED.
B:	Yeah.
B:	All those old good ones that you, you know, wish they had on  more now,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but.
A:	When I was a little kid, I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve
A:	and  it was so good that I had forgotten  that it was Christmas Eve.
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean  that's something for a kid.
B:	That's pretty good.
B:	Really.
A:	And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time, I'll tell you.
B:	Let's see.
B:	What are some other ones I've seen lately.
B:	I'm trying to remember.
B:	I can't.
B:	Oh, I just saw one on the video.
B:	Oh, um, have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, PART TWO?
A:	No
B:	That is a riot.
A:	Is it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	The first one was really good.
B:	But the second one  is really good too.
B:	I was really surprised.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I didn't much care for the first one.
A:	Maybe that's,
B:	No,
B:	I thought it was funny.
B:	But, that's my sense of humor
A:	Well, I, I'll have to go get that one I guess.
B:	It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.
B:	And I'm just, I guess I'm just middle America or something.
B:	I just go to be entertained
B:	and  and not really interested in some of the, like the TERMINATOR or some of the Schwarzenegger stuff.
A:	Yeah.  Yeah. *b
B:	I just.
A:	I get so tired of, you know, these, you know, sequels.
A:	Number nine, number ten, number  fourteen.
B:	Yeah.
B:	FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTY-FIVE or whatever.
A:	Yeah, you know.
A:	Yeah, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've never,
A:	FREDDY EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD, you know.
A:	I, I'm just,
A:	I'm so sick and tired of that.
A:	I just can't believe it.
A:	It's like ROCKY films.
A:	I  I haven't seen a one.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've never seen any of those.
A:	I can't stand Stallone.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I can't either.
B:	He seems so macho I just
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I, I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do, you know.  Go into fourteen hundred episodes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now I don't, I hardly ever watch T V.
A:	If I ever get the hankering to see something, I've got, I don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies
A:	and I just,
B:	Yeah.
B:	When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't even rent them. You know.
B:	You don't?
A:	I, I figure if I find a movie I like, I'll buy it.
A:	Cause I just watch them over and over again.
B:	That's like,
B:	my husband does that.
B:	He can watch  them over and over.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I,
B:	And I'm,
B:	there's very few I would want to see that many times.
B:	So he, he, once he has one he likes, he likes to watch it over and over.
A:	Yeah.
A:	My, my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is, uh, EXCALIBUR.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That was a good one.
B:	I haven't seen that one in a long time.
A:	I, I loved that film. Um,
A:	it's just so well done.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I lived over in England for four years,
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	That was the first place I ever saw it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it was just, gosh,
A:	it was so good.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	It was, it was filmed in Ireland.
B:	Huh.
A:	And they got pretty scenery in Ireland.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I bet
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's nice.
B:	Gosh.
A:	And I, I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was.
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	So, that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was, yeah it was unimpressive to look at.
A:	I mean, the whole thing was about the size of a, a medium house
A:	Yeah.
A:	It wasn't,
B:	Oh, really
B:	Well, when I was in England years ago.
B:	And I went to, to like Shakespeare's and, you know, Stratford-On-Avon  and all that
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it
B:	because it was so  short.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The ceilings  were so short.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There's some nice stuff over there to see.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I spent four years traveling around and didn't see, you know, hardly anything.
A:	I just,
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	I need, to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel.  Go around all the places.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Stonehenge, of course, you know.
A:	Every, everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	big deal.
A:	Here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field.
A:	Okay
A:	It's boring.
B:	Did you see any movies over there
B:	I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out.
B:	It came out right around the time, with Sophia Loren
B:	and that was a riot to see that.
A:	You know something,
A:	I, come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Cause when you're touristing, you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie.
A:	I, uh,
A:	where I lived. Uh, it was a little town called Newmarket. About seventy miles north of London.
B:	Huh.
B:	Oh, boy
A:	And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they had a little, uh, theater company there
A:	and we use to go, go out to that about once a week.
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	A really nice place.
A:	You know, amateurs but really quite good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but that was interesting.
A:	Course  go to London quite a lot and see shows down there.
B:	That sounds great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Never any, anyway, anything that I ever wanted,
A:	I rented a lot of videos
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Cause the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds
A:	and who wants  who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	Probably some of them did
A:	A lot of, a lot of people did.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But it would have to be a good show.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I
A:	they, they, they have all these neat phrases. You know, you know, you know. Like critically acclaimed.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. *listen
B:	Oh, I see
A:	You know. They can't,
B:	It's kind of like waterfront property or something  if you're, you know, if you're two miles away from water
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	from Love Canal
B:	Water view
A:	Waterfront property here at Love Canal, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, you know, critically acclaimed.
A:	Oh, good grief.
A:	Give me a break.
A:	That's
A:	I mean, there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And primarily, I mean, I, now I'm probably going to, going to upset you.
A:	But people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
A:	Okay,
A:	we're energized.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um, painting,
A:	interesting.
A:	Uh, the guy called me,
A:	when she called me, the computer called me, I thought that they were reading my mind.
A:	I'm in the middle of, um, going out for bids to have my house painted.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, painting is not hard to do, uh, as long as it's not in, not to the point of where it 's, uh, needs to be scraped and peeling,
B:	No.
B:	Right.
A:	and our house is not
A:	but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap
A:	and it's just a hassle to go through it
A:	so I'm looking for the easy way out.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I know.
B:	is easy to find uh, painters to do this for you?
A:	It's easier to find painters,
A:	but you have to be, you have to be aware of what, uh, how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good, a good two coats, and are they, going to caulk,
B:	are you talking, outside or inside?
A:	Exterior.
B:	Exterior,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, interior's not so bad because it's more fun,
A:	it's more,
A:	but yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	outside you have high peeks, and those kind of things,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it can be a real issue.
B:	Well, when we've painted, um,
B:	right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there,
B:	it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles, on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.
B:	Um, but, it,
B:	the problem is that it hits, the sun hits it.
B:	So preparing is a real problem,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you've got to prepare it well
B:	or else it will flake.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um,
A:	Here they,
A:	some of the home builders are,
A:	they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money
A:	so they put up, uh, a quarter inch Masonite, basically,
A:	and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts
A:	so it's real cheap.
A:	And, uh, uh, I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and I, as low as five hundred and forty dollars
A:	so it's, just a matter of,
B:	Wow. that's quite a range.
A:	it's,
A:	Oh, there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
A:	and I'm so much worried about that as what, I don't want it all over the brick and windows
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	which might be a bigger problem than it would be, uh,
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	absolutely
A:	So y'all, you haven't had any, any jobs painted in your house or recently .
B:	No,
B:	we 've have, uh, done a little painting ourselves, um,
B:	we painted the bedroom, uh, well within the last couple of months,
A:	That's fun.
B:	and we have, we have some more that need to be done,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,
B:	and, um, when we bought it the, um, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired,
B:	but the daughter was a real estate agent
B:	and she was selling it
B:	and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house.
B:	So she told us that the house had been, uh, professionally painted recently.
B:	And it looked pretty good, you know, the, uh, the interior walls all basically white,
B:	but they obviously had been done without to much, uh, wear afterward.
B:	The only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the uh, the door frames,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it.
A:	Uh, that's not very,
B:	Big long strips.
B:	So what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.
B:	And some of still has to be redone.
A:	Oh, they just painted over varnished wood.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Oh, my,
B:	well, no
B:	actually it had been, uh, it would have been, it had been a repaint job.
A:	Um.
B:	But they had not,
B:	either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top
B:	or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,
B:	because it was woodwork
B:	so it looked as if it had been painted, correctly with, you know, uh, an enamel or something,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, it had not,
B:	either that or it had not been prepared underneath
B:	and it was greasy or something,
A:	Sure.
B:	it comes off in strips, I mean not even little bit.
B:	So we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time,
A:	Oh, no.
B:	we know what a job it's going to be
B:	because you almost have to strip the whole thing, in order to do it again.
A:	Um.
A:	I wish you good luck.
B:	Okay
A:	Thank you very much.
B:	Thank you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	So, how do you feel about our policy in Latin America?
B:	Oh, I'm all in favor of it,
B:	yeah
B:	No,
B:	I, uh, I think we've been doing a pretty good job, you know, not, uh, not taking advantage of our, you know, of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us, you know, uh,
B:	I mean we could direct the government even more than we have been.
B:	I don't think we've been doing too bad.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, do you think that's, do you think that's right?
A:	Do you think, we should direct the government?
B:	Um.
B:	Well, I think that, uh, as a whole that the, being that the drug problem, the drug industry can, uh, bring so much money to a country.
B:	I think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the the drug, uh, cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America.
A:	Yeah
B:	Just that, uh, money is power,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh,
A:	Well, I have a friend that's, uh,
A:	his descendants are from, uh, uh, Nicaragua and, uh, very,
A:	I mean it's like his mother, his, mother came over
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, he, you know,
A:	I just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about, you know, our intervention and their government and stuff like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he, he was all for it because it's just like you say, uh,
A:	there's so many people there that, that get the kind of control that's bad, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that their governments can become so corrupt
A:	and it's like, well, you know, I use to feel like,
A:	well, they, they, should work their way, you know,
A:	they should, should be able to work their self out of it
A:	or, you know, why, why, why intervene in another country's, you know, problems and things like that.
A:	Why, why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that
A:	but I think just a lot of times if we don't then, then it, then that influence will affect our country too for one.
A:	And for two, you know, that it does help.
A:	I mean, you know, I think the people in those country do want our help. The people that are under conditions that are, you know, not favorable to this their rights.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
B:	But, uh,
A:	But, uh, I wish we didn't have to.
A:	I mean I'd rather,
A:	even if a country chooses a government that's not, you know, exactly the kind of government that we have, you know or, or as in complete opposition to it, at least it's their choice, as long, as long it's one that's, that, that makes since, so to speak, you know,
A:	it is a government that stays in power, that can stay in power,
A:	but it seems like most of them don't you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, sometimes that's, that's America doing that too you know,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	we, we fall out of, uh, agreements with certain leaders
B:	and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader, you know
B:	It's, uh,
A:	So you think like C I A influence and our money over there.
B:	That, and, uh, that and,
B:	yeah,
B:	America starts talking then about removing bases and, and whatnot and, stuff like that, and people.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Or, or government aids and stuff.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that has a lot of things to did with, uh, um,
A:	Well, then how can you, how can you say as far as like in, uh, Europe, as far as the, the toppling of those kinds of governments, you know, like,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was, uh,
A:	I mean,
B:	I'm, I'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not,
B:	because on one hand you have, you know, that the, you know, the, Soviet Government, of course, mistreating a lot of the, uh, Slovak countries and then, on the other hand, you have, well,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they, they were feeding us, you know,
B:	so, uh I don't know really what's going to happen.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But we don't, we're not intervening in that,
A:	or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing
B:	Oh,
A:	Are,
B:	yeah.
B:	I think we're getting quite a,
B:	put it this way, I think,
B:	no,
B:	I think the people are, revolting themselves,
A:	And,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we're, uh, allowing, it to happen.
A:	See, I, I agree with that.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I agree that, that the communication that now, that communication has, become so much more widespread and, you know, worldwide that people are realizing hey, we don't have it so good and let's stand up
B:	Right.
A:	you know, uh, this is ridiculous
A:	we're living, with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that, uh,
A:	I think people are just saying, no way, we don't want anywhere of this.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think, uh, Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive, you know, where it's always the minority that are, are trying to make the country better.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I mean, I don't mean to,
A:	well, I guess I do in a way,
A:	sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that.
A:	I think that, that, uh, because of those countries a lot, you know, where such Catholic influence.
A:	And I think the Catholic religion itself was, was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down, so to speak,
B:	I thought, it was the other way around.
A:	but,
B:	They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this,
B:	so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it, it's been, sort of like, you know.
A:	Uh.
A:	But, but see, but I don't agree with that because the Catholic religion, as far as through the ages has been the rule, so to speak.
A:	You know, they are the ones that set, that set a lot of the rules
A:	and they are the ones that do keep the people down,
A:	I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're, yet they're expected to bow down to it, I think that keeps people in sort of line, you know.
B:	I don't quite understand that.
B:	Do they even understand what's being said?
A:	Well, when, when it use to be Latin.
A:	I'm just saying, that, the old church.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	the old church.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Which it's not that way now
A:	but I think that there is, just that, I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around.
B:	Well, they actually understood,
B:	it is in America where it was hard
B:	Latin, you know is very, very, very close to Spanish.
A:	Well, Latin,
A:	Uh, they still didn't understand it though, I don't think,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because I, I descend from that.
A:	And I, you know, I don't, can't, I don't understand Latin
B:	Uh. Yeah.
A:	and I'm of Spanish descent.
A:	So um, I, I just think that has something to do with why Latinos or, tend to be, you know, the the more meek, you know,
A:	they tend to be more,
A:	like not stand up for their rights as much.
A:	They're not really sure of what they are. I don't think.
B:	Uh, I never really thought of, it that way.
A:	Well, I mean, how, can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to, to say the people in Latin America.
A:	I mean, why are they, why are they not as vocal
A:	or why do they not, you know, stand up, so to speak, for their rights?
B:	I don't know,
B:	could be the, the economic still.
B:	You know, the,
B:	there's,
B:	the poverty level is certainly, uh, you know, much worse in the Latin American countries.
B:	I mean, you can say that about Africa too.
B:	I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic, uh, country,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and yet, you know, they have the same problem where, you know, where kings and such,
A:	Uh, I don't, agree with that.
A:	I don't agree,
A:	because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in, in, uh, Africa.
A:	I think they've made a lot more chances.
A:	They, they've, their very vocal.
B:	Well, in South Africa,
B:	yeah
B:	In South Africa I think they are,
B:	but yet, you know,
A:	So, what's the difference?
B:	Idi Amin was, you know, in power for so long.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. *b
B:	Uh, racial, I think
B:	or like you say, maybe communication of knowing that, hey, up in other English colonies, or previous English colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not,
B:	you know, I think communication does have a lot to do with it, you know, in education, maybe.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know about education
B:	because the black community is still not very educated down there.
B:	So, I think it is communication,
B:	it's just oopsy.
A:	I think it maybe has to do with a a lot to do with education
A:	because you look at the, uh, European countries,
A:	I think they tend to be more educated, much more, educated than, than Africa or the Latin American countries.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	You know that,
B:	I don't know whether, uh,
B:	actually I, I've always wondered whether, how the education system works in the Russian countries, the Republics, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I know that Russia, they're, they're comparably more, better educated than we are, in our country.
B:	Really.
B:	That's good, in a way
B:	You know, uh, something we compete with.
A:	Yeah
B:	Uh, and I've been sort of disappointed how that they, they say literacy rate has gone down, you know,
B:	that's sort of upsetting, to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer
A:	Yeah.
A:	In our country?
B:	In our country,
B:	yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that is really upsetting
B:	and, and, considering it's free, you know,
B:	I mean good education is really still free.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's just it though, good education.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is it good education?
A:	It may be free but is it good education
A:	and that's just it
A:	are we willing to pay for it, you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. *b
A:	I mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all
A:	but, so are they willing to, pay for, you know quality education, you know?
A:	So, you know, and yet they, yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology, you know, that we use to dominate
A:	and it's like well, you know, they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do.
A:	So, you're going to have to expect it.
A:	So what you,
A:	are you willing to compromise a little and, and pay, pay some, take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education.
A:	So, I don't know.
B:	Uh.
A:	But, I, I,
A:	Okay.
B:	So, who is your favorite football team?
A:	Guess.
A:	I bet you can't guess
B:	Well, I would say the Saints after , since ,
A:	You got it.
A:	And I want to tell you something.
B:	What's that?
A:	They're going to go somewhere pretty shortly.
B:	Yeah?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think they are because they're getting better every year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, they, got a lot,
B:	Can't, call them the New Orleans Ain'ts any more.
A:	I don't think so.
B:	No.
A:	We went to the playoffs.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
B:	Well, I'm a, I'm a Buffalo Bills fan. from a, from a long time ago.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now I like them, too.
B:	So, it's good to, it's good to see the Bills doing so well now
B:	and,
A:	They are.
A:	They are doing a whole bunch better.
A:	Who's, their quarterback?
B:	Yeah.
B:	What's that?
A:	Who's their quarterback?
B:	Uh, Jim Kelly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I like to watch them, too.
A:	They're the,
A:	I like to watch almost all the football
A:	but, um, of course, I watch every Saints game that I can watch.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I think they're going to, I think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If they would just quit blowing it.
B:	Well, the,
B:	it,
B:	the, the N F L draft really seems to be doing its job
B:	because, got teams like, like Buffalo who weren't, certainly weren't a powerhouse, uh, ten years ago.
B:	Now, they've been able to get some good players and come around
B:	and
B:	New Orleans the same story
B:	and, uh, a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse
B:	and then they, uh, they weren't getting the draft picks
B:	and now the, uh, other team,
B:	so it seems to be, uh, moving around and, uh, to, to New Orleans' benefit,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, you see how,
B:	look at the Cowboys now And, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Really bad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they got so much bad publicity, too.
A:	And I think that hurt a lot of, you know, people even wanting to play on their team.
B:	Yeah.
B:	well, yeah.
B:	Uh, firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson
B:	what, what kind of, uh, uh,
B:	doesn't give you much respect for their team at all.
B:	Any any team that, where the owner would fire Tom Landry, you know, is like one of the greatest coaches of all time.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And just because they had, had a couple of bad seasons.
B:	And you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because all the problems,
A:	I mean, if you think about those years that we had the losing season, of how bad,
A:	I mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs, because of, uh, you know, messing with young children
B:	Right.
A:	and, I mean, it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other, with them.
B:	Right.
B:	And he
B:	and, uh, had a lot of trouble with injuries, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, he'd, uh, never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy.
B:	And then even like, uh, what is it, Eric Dickerson left, the team, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you're right.
B:	You know, like people were jumping ship right and left.
A:	Right.
B:	And, I don't know,
B:	that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem,
B:	but then the team was sold.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	But, uh, that Jimmy Johnson came in, too, though,
A:	and he just, you know,
A:	when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided, you know, this is the way it's going to be
A:	and it was bad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, it really was.
A:	To me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild
A:	because everything, I mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had, he was going to change it.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean it's,
A:	I mean, you know, that's the way I felt about it.
A:	But, I tell you what,
B:	Well, Yeah.
A:	if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback isn't nobody going to beat us
A:	There ain't nobody going to beat us then.
A:	Because look how good we did without a quarterback this year
B:	I know.
B:	Who was the quarterback?
A:	Well,  They,  had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it. Uh,
B:	See, I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback,  is.
A:	Fourcade was for a while.
A:	And then, um, I can't remember that guy's name, the one that held out for the money
A:	and he was across the river
A:	Uh, I can't think of the, I can't think of his name now,
A:	but really we didn't have a quarterback.
A:	That,  was the whole problem.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We had one guy that couldn't throw
A:	and we had one guy that couldn't run.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, it was, it was just bedlam.
A:	We really didn't have a quarterback.
A:	It was, uh, defense won all the games.
B:	Did they, were they able to draft anybody this year?
A:	I don't know
A:	because, you know, they gave away a lot of their drafts. For different people for, you know, other places.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	So, I don't know.
A:	I hadn't heard, you know, whether they have a new one or not.
B:	Well, when is the, N F L draft
A:	But, uh,
B:	hasn't, has the N F L draft even gone yet?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Not yet.
A:	But, I mean, I don't know whether they have one of the first, you know, choices of somebody,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	that would be real good.
B:	Well, they've,
B:	yeah,
B:	they've,
A:	I mean,
A:	everybody gets in draft.
B:	Sure.
A:	But, I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Or even making the playoffs
B:	so that doesn't, doesn't help you in the draft.
A:	Right.
A:	But we, really, I mean, really and truly we just don't have a quarterback,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	that's all there is to it.
A:	But, the players and stuff, they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because we had some,
A:	you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback?
B:	That was a few years ago.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, he was good.
A:	But we, every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, of course, we had a different coach then, too.
A:	But they'd treat him bad Or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies. *sd
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And it was weird.
A:	It was like they were trying, if you were good, boy , let's don't have you on our team, you know.
A:	But, um, this year they had all good players except for the quarterback.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The quarterback, all of them, every one that they played,
A:	I think they played, uh,
A:	I can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks,
A:	but all of them were bad.
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean, they were terrible.
A:	They could not pitch.
A:	You know, they couldn't even take handoffs.
A:	It was, terrible
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, all the other places, I mean, our defense was unbelievable.
B:	Oh, that's one, it's one thing,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Buffalo's,  lucky though to have, uh, Jim Kelly than,
A:	Did you get to watch any of their games?
B:	now he's the number one rated quarterback in the N F L. I think,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm pretty sure he was this past season.
B:	And, uh, then with, uh, uh, the defense, with Bruce Bruce Smith there at linebacker there, they've got a very well rounded team
B:	and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they, problems they had in the past
B:	and now they're, uh, really playing as a, good together as a team.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	Um. Do you watch it every Sunday?
B:	Uh, when I can.
B:	I'm a, I'm a musician
B:	and, uh, the band I play in, uh, I,
B:	this is just something on the side
B:	and, uh, the band I play in, we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays.
B:	So I missed a lot of Sundays during this,
A:	Um.
A:	Did you ever get to watch any of the, uh, New Orleans games? Um. *b
B:	I, I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans games, per se.
B:	New Orleans just isn't, isn't one of the areas,
B:	I've lived in so many places.
B:	I've lived in, uh, Denver
B:	but I don't like the Broncos.
B:	There's, no love for the Broncos.
B:	But, I've lived in, uh, uh,
A:	No.
B:	I was born in Buffalo
B:	and I lived in, uh, outside of Boston for five years
B:	and then my family lives in Philadelphia now
B:	and, uh, so I tend to look for, uh, uh,
A:	Teams in your area.
B:	and I lived in Detroit, too.
B:	So I like, uh,
B:	first of all, first and foremost the Bills games I want to see.
B:	And then I'll, uh, normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots
B:	and, Patriots were so depressing this last year that yeah, that, uh, I kind of gave up on them.
A:	I know it
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, first and foremost the Bills.
B:	I even
B:	I went to, got to go to a Bills game this year, which was fun.
B:	It was the, the Bills, Eagles game, which appropriately enough fortunately, the Bills won.
A:	Oh,
A:	that's neat.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it was good weather.
A:	Yes.
B:	We beat Buffalo in, in, uh, was it third of December?
B:	And, it was sunny and forty-five degrees.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	So, we couldn't a done much better than that in Buffalo
A:	No.
A:	Because usually it's snowing
B:	Yeah.
A:	Ice and rain and everything.
B:	Sure.
A:	But, I tell you what,
A:	if you get to watch some of these,
A:	now I don't know how it will be this year, you know,
A:	but, I mean, these games go right down to the wire.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair, you know, going oh, no, no.
A:	And one, uh,
A:	I can't remember.
A:	It was about, uh,
A:	it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs, or not
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, we're watching the game.
A:	All right.
A:	The other team got the ball
A:	and we had like, no, we got the ball back.
A:	That's the way it was.
A:	And they had to kick. And, uh, to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we had to sit there, you know,
A:	and they cut the show off and started showing us another football game.
A:	We did not get to see the end of the game.
A:	You talk about people calling in.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	It was wild.
A:	I mean, here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair, you know,
B:	Sure,
B:	and then they changed the game.
A:	and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another, you know, one that was going on.
B:	Right.
A:	Cut us off right there the last few seconds.
A:	The station finally, you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom. Started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off, that it was the national, you know,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	It was the network.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	because it was funny.
A:	I mean everybody was furious.
A:	I was so mad I got up and went and called, you know,
A:	I couldn't believe that.
A:	But, almost every game that I watched it would come right down to the end,
A:	we would be ahead, you know,
A:	but then at the in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or, you know, right ahead of them.
B:	Right.
A:	And it'd come right down to the end
A:	and either we made it or we didn't.
A:	Oh, and it was, it was something else.
A:	I said this is the most,
A:	if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl.
B:	Yeah.
A:	There's no question about it, because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks.
A:	And the quarterbacks just didn't do anything.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's the, that's the guy that counts
A:	Yes.
A:	But, maybe we, maybe we'll get your guy.
B:	Oh, I, I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time.
A:	Um, so do you have a personal computer?
B:	Uh, well we do have one in, in our home, uh,
B:	it's on the fritz right now, because the monitor isn't working properly
B:	but, uh, it has been, uh, used tremendously, mostly by my children for, uh, playing games
A:	Oh
B:	However, um, you know, the bane of our existence these days,
B:	uh, but it does have a word processing program, which all of us have used for reports and papers and that sort of thing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what,
A:	when this subject was mentioned to us I said, well,
A:	I went, gee, that's all I use mine for is a word processor,
A:	and I haven't used it since I got out of college,
A:	and that was six years ago,
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	but it, it was my sister's who,
A:	my sister bought it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, my father had a small business
A:	and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business,
A:	and he never did,
B:	Oh.
A:	he always did everything out by hand.
A:	He only had three employees,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	so, you know, it wasn't really worth it to him to do, to do it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Actually, it would be worth it, if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand.
A:	Yeah,
A:	like pay, the payroll
A:	and,
B:	Exactly,
B:	and there are, lots of them on the market.
A:	yeah,
A:	basically payroll.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But you do have to research that, find out what works for your system
B:	What kind do you have?
A:	Um, it's an I B M,
A:	I think it's a Professional Three Hundred,
A:	no,
A:	that's, that's the digital one.
A:	It's an, uh, I B M P C Junior, I think.
B:	Oh, well, that's a nice computer.
A:	Yeah
A:	she, she, uh, she uses it now, uh, my sister, to,
A:	actually, she moved She took it with her, *sd because she needed it to do,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	so she took it with her
B:	Yeah,
B:	don't blame her.
A:	she just finished up her Bachelor's degree
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I don't know if she's going to even use it anymore.
A:	It, it's,
B:	Yeah
B:	Oh, well, well, encourage her to try other things,
B:	because, um, I am, uh,
B:	I work in a school system,
B:	and I teach writing
B:	and we use the computers a great deal for word processing, you know, because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer, as you probably found out yourself,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, um, I also am sponsoring a literary magazine,
B:	and we're doing our entire layout on the computer uh, because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have, a publishing program
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that's, that's neat,
A:	that's, a very good use.
B:	So, it is wonderful,
B:	once you get into some of the programs that are out now, you can do so much with them, that you don't do until you really make yourself use them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I know there, there's got to be a lot of uses,
A:	but it's just you have, to have a need.
B:	You have to make yourself do it,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but you have to have a need.
A:	I really have no need for it at all,
B:	Yeah.
A:	um, I work for Digital Equipment
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we have a powerful computer down at work.
B:	Oh
B:	so, you don't need a personal one
A:	No,
A:	and I, I still really don't do that much, as you say, play games on it
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	they're great for playing games.
B:	Right.
A:	My brother,
B:	Well, my son is, uh, studying electronic technology,
B:	and he's been able to do things on uh, on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his, um, reports, and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, and I guess it,
B:	if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful,
B:	but, um, unless it is, I guess it's kind of a waste.
A:	I know some people who just,
A:	they just went through a course, uh, and took the electronic grafting course, drafting, not grafting, but drafting course,
B:	Oh, that's, fascinating.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
A:	the C A D.
B:	I knew what you meant,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and that's really neat,
A:	I mean, yeah,
A:	you can do graphs, graphs on it too,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but this is, you know, this is one step above it,
A:	but it's actual, um, drafting,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I always,
B:	Yes,
B:	you can do wonderful design.
B:	It, it's really,
B:	well, especially when anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering uh, drawing, um,
B:	you have to be so precise.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the computer does it all for you.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it was really neat.
A:	I wanted to go to that course,
A:	but my boss wouldn't pay for it,
B:	Oh, well
A:	I'm like, I'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it,
A:	I'll be needed.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because, um, I, I, I didn't want to go do it myself
A:	because I didn't think I was really going to use it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I got this cough,
A:	I've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and I went outside with no coat on.
B:	Oh, boy
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was bad.
B:	What a change, huh?
A:	Yes,
A:	it was a big change.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot,
A:	and then, again, I picked up a cold.
B:	Right.
A:	But I'm doing all right, getting over it.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	So I don't, I don't even know how much, um, personal computers cost nowadays.
B:	Well, they vary tremendously.
B:	Um, because you can get
B:	because you're, they're, uh,
B:	the ones that were made a few years ago, uh, have come down in price significantly, um,
B:	you can get them, I've seen them for five, and six hundred dollars,
B:	but they 're much less, um, have much less memory, and capable, of much less.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they can't do your, um, your drafting and your graphs, and all of that.
B:	no,
B:	you can't do very much on them.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Um, well, it's just that you have to have, uh, you have to be able to get your program in,
B:	and, and, many of the programs are so big, uh,
B:	they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work.
B:	You don't have any, bytes left
A:	Yeah?
B:	but, um, if you, um, if, if you want to go into one that's really useful, you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars,
B:	and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much,
B:	and we've,
B:	ours is not quite that powerful,
B:	and so, you know, we are, we are limited, which may be one reason why,
A:	You do run you do run into limitations on yours?
B:	Oh, yeah,
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	uh-huh,
B:	some things we can't do,
B:	but, but then we haven't needed to either, you know, um,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but we've been able to do what we can.
A:	Wow, that's neat that you you even reach the limits of yours.
A:	I haven't even begun to reach the limits,
B:	No,
B:	but I,
B:	mine is not as good as a P C, uh, uh, Junior,
A:	Junior,
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	ours is a Commodore One Twenty-eight.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it, it's not quite as, um, as useful, not quite as powerful.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They, say that Commodore has made a good, um, P C for the price, though.
B:	So,
B:	They did,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's very true,
B:	that's very true,
B:	they did.
A:	Very competitive.
A:	I don't even, I don't even know much money my sister spent on hers,
A:	but I, I just thought I, it's, it's going to be a waste,
A:	she's not going to do it, not going to use it.
A:	Oh, well.
B:	Sounds like he, that you were right
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, she likes it,
A:	she gets to write her reports,
A:	but like I say, she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And she could have bought a typewriter also
A:	Yeah,
A:	a typewriter with memory would, would have been fine,
B:	Yeah,
A:	it's all she uses it for.
B:	yeah.
A:	Um, I think it might have a spelling editor on it,
A:	I'm not sure. Yeah. *b
B:	Yeah,
B:	it,
B:	yeah,
B:	it
B:	if, if it doesn't she could easily put it on.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	that's one of, the one great thing about it
B:	Right.
B:	Which program did you use?
B:	Did you use Word Perfect?
A:	Um, no,
A:	I, I really don't,
A:	it's, it was six years ago.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	She pretty much set it up.
A:	She goes, here, this is, you make your file, and then you can, uh, edit it.
A:	Right?
A:	Um, I used the one, the one at work a lot, um,
A:	matter of fact, anything I've had to write from now on, I had to
A:	God forbid,
A:	write a couple of resumes, *listen to this and the previous two utts--same or separate?
A:	and I was just great,
A:	and all you have to do is just put it in a, uh, the spelling check mode,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I don't even have to look my, my words up anymore.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're great,
B:	you're right
B:	Well, I guess we've spent our time.
A:	Oh,
B:	I need to go help my daughter do something,
B:	so this has been fun talking to you.
A:	Okay,
A:	good.
A:	Okay.
B:	Good luck.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, bye.
B:	Uh, bye-bye.
A:	Well, do you think, uh,
A:	I mean I wonder,
A:	the assumption is that it is a problem, uh,
A:	and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem, though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem
A:	and, uh, but it's not clear to me that it is.
B:	Uh,
A:	Um, it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically, or in terms of their opinions.
A:	But if those who don't vote, if you made them vote
A:	and, it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way, you know, in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's not clear to me that it is really a problem, um.
B:	Um, that's, that's interesting,
B:	because I had thought,
B:	I feel that it's a problem also,
B:	but, I see your point on that.
A:	I mean, I, I assume that those who don't vote,
A:	I mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote, they tend to be, you know,
A:	poor blacks, for example, vote very little, and things like that
A:	and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting, than your average voter.
A:	But I don't know if that's the case.
B:	Uh.
A:	In fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't.
B:	Apparently they don't think it's a problem
A:	Uh, I guess not,
A:	I'm, I, I vote religiously,
A:	I really do.
A:	Um, I guess, I guess I'm a fan of democracy
A:	and, uh, wish I could vote on more things frankly.
B:	That's right, um,
A:	But it's funny because here in California things are getting, uh, increasingly democratically oriented, in, in the sense of people being able to vote for things.
A:	I mean, we have these initiatives, state initiatives now.
B:	Oh.
A:	The first really popular, you know wide spread one was, uh, Proposition Thirteen which was a, uh, tax revolt,  against property taxes.
B:	Right,
B:	I
A:	Uh, and, you know, now we're,
A:	and that was whatever, ten years ago
A:	and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that.
A:	I mean, we've just,
A:	there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked, being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals
A:	and you had to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them
A:	and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them
A:	and it was incredibly complicated and difficult.
A:	And a lot of people revolted against that,
A:	they said we don't want to have to decide all these things,
A:	you know, that's, that's, that's why we hire people who, uh, you know, to, to make these decisions for us.
B:	I, I kind of feel the opposite, though.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things.
A:	I do
B:	I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us
B:	but they're not speaking for me.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I wouldn't mind having, oh, more votes than I get to have, frankly
B:	That's true.
A:	Anyone who doesn't vote, it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote.
A:	That would make me happy though.
A:	Maybe not in a, in a deep philosophical sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would.
A:	I don't know,
A:	it's interesting, uh, some countries voting is obligatory.
A:	Uh, it is in Australia, for example.
B:	Is that true?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I didn't know that,
B:	I was
B:	that is one solution to it.
A:	I don't know how I feel about that.
B:	But I don't,
B:	that's not really democratic. Not what I'd consider truly democratic.
A:	Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States.
B:	As,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And it's not for me to say that they're not.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, they, they feel,
A:	I mean here you have the right to vote
A:	and they simply define it as a duty there.
A:	You know, we have, just as we have a a duty to pay taxes, you know,
A:	is that democratic?
A:	I mean, we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country,
A:	we have the duty to pay taxes.
B:	It's a duty, right.
A:	And in that country it's a duty to pay taxes
A:	and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent.
A:	And it's not clear to me that, that's so much less democratic.
A:	Um. I don't know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but part of me rebels against that,
B:	I, it's, that's,  it's complex question when you start thinking about it, isn't it
A:	but then I'm an American.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And some people don't vote,
A:	I mean there is
A:	like three or four percent of Australians don't vote
A:	and I think they're eligible for a fine.
A:	I don't know if they actually are fined or, or what happens,
A:	but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	I have people here that I know that have never registered to vote.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think, I think they feel they can criticize if they don't
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was sort of,
B:	I told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize.
A:	Well I,
A:	that's how I feel.
A:	I mean, if if you vote and your guy looses well you you least tried
A:	and you can say something
A:	but if you don't vote, I sort of feel like, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what's coming to you, you know.
B:	That's right,
B:	I feel
A:	And certainly that's true in the overall,
A:	I mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole,
A:	I sort of feel that way. When they especially when someone, they, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for, or something like that. *listen: two utts?
A:	And, you know, I say well, you know, voting for the lesser of two evils is still important.
B:	I think it is too.
B:	Sometimes it is a difficult choice.
B:	You don't feel as though you have much of a choice,
B:	but
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I mean, you, I mean, it's, it's funny because technically you do.
A:	I mean you have the right to do a write in candidate.
A:	But of course that's, that's not really a vote.
A:	Um.
B:	It doesn't really gain anything.
A:	Yes,
A:	it really doesn't,
A:	and so it's, it's a complicated situation,
A:	but I would like to see,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I, I, I'm, I'm thinking of actually moving to Australia
A:	and,  and perhaps I'll call you back and let you know what, how the Australian system works.
B:	Is that
A:	I mean, not because of the I mean I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting,  but just because of a job opportunity.
B:	Not
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, uh, I,
B:	I'm are you a T I employee, I'm interested.
A:	No,
A:	I'm not.
B:	Not,
B:	okay,
B:	I just wondered.
A:	And, uh, so I'm, I'm really quite, quite curious, how that would work, to have both, I mean, you know,
A:	and I believe in the, in a certain, uh,
A:	Soviet bloc countries you are, are obliged to vote too.
A:	In fact, it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for, up until fairly recently
A:	and, that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote.
A:	But when you actually, really are given as much choice as you are in this country, with its two party system, um,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I kind of,
A:	part of me is wary
A:	and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty, um.
B:	Well, uh, maybe they should,
B:	perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age.  Required to register and vote for four years,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well that's a thought,
A:	or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have,
A:	I don't know.
A:	The right to write your,
B:	Maybe it should go with a driver's license
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, see that's an example of a right, not a, not a,
A:	actually
A:	that's considered a privilege, not a right.
B:	That is a privilege,
B:	right,
A:	Yeah,
A:	but technically people, most people,
A:	technically it's a privilege,
A:	but most people think of it as a right.
A:	I mean, in other words if the government denies you driving, denies you a driver's license, people get very upset.
A:	But actually it's a privilege,  which is allowed to be revoked.
B:	It is.
B:	That's correct.
A:	And, fortunately voting isn't that.
B:	Maybe it should, maybe it should be.
A:	Except, well except if you're a felon,
A:	if you're a felon it is taken away from you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, they will take away your right to vote, under certain circumstances.
B:	That's right.
A:	Um, so, gosh,
A:	so we don't have a great solution yet do we
B:	Don't have a great
B:	I, I think I checked that as a question I'd be willing to discuss too
B:	Oh.
A:	But I, I also, I also, I don't know if you've, uh, read any of the, um, oh, what do they call those. The, uh, the early republican, uh, republic documents, uh, when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	I haven't.
A:	Um, oh, I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican, not in the sense of the Republican party now,  versus a democratic, uh, government and, arguing successfully, why, the United States should be a republic, not a democracy. Which indeed it really is, a republic, not a democracy.
B:	Right.
A:	Where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues.
A:	In other words, you vote for representatives.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the whole idea was, um, presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person, and, and, a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,
A:	Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority.
A:	And, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process,
A:	because anytime you have a majority, um, they can change the law in a a fully democratic process
A:	and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case. Um,
A:	oh, you know, a
A:	if there's some minority that people don't like because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote vote against them.
B:	Right.
A:	And cases like that, he argues, need to be constrained,
A:	and, and actually I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote
B:	Sometimes I think we have that right now, with Congress.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I, I mean, I feel that, I feel that
B:	I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well their job is to be reelected, by in large,
A:	and, so they work on that job.
A:	And there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, you know, where government is misspending your dollars
A:	and, and they're all fools,
A:	and you know, throw, throw the bastards out,
A:	that kind of thing.
B:	Right.
A:	And, there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange,
A:	because, I mean, if I'm hiring a plumber, I want a real plumber,
A:	I want someone trained in,
A:	Well, uh, what what do you think about the metric system?
A:	Uh, do you, uh, find it useable?
A:	Have you tried much with it?
B:	Well, with an engineering,  degree, it's, of course, it's a whole lot easier.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because, uh,
A:	To use you mean,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah,
B:	if, if somebody is totally unfamiliar with it, uh, human nature being what it is we don't like to change.
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh, it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	We,
A:	well I've lived both in the United States and, and in a country where they do use the metric system
A:	and, uh, so I've, I've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over.
A:	Um, the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and,  pounds to uh, uh, kilograms,
B:	Right.
B:	That's right.
A:	and, I think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute, an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters,
B:	Right.
A:	how on earth am I every going to do the math? *spelling
B:	Right.
A:	And the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or whatever, and, you know, and leaving it at that
A:	and, uh, you know, a kilogram weighs about this much
A:	and get used to it from scratch,
A:	cause I still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters
A:	but I'm perfectly comfortable using either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think the real problem with this, this weird conversion, you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and, you know, whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour, you know,
A:	people, you know,
A:	it's hard to take it seriously.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And as long as both were given, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,
A:	you just say, well look read the miles per hour one,
A:	the other one must be for someone else.
B:	That's right.
A:	Uh, I don't know,
A:	I mean even Britain has converted over
A:	and we inherited this mess from them
A:	and, uh,
B:	That's right,
B:	it's all their fault.
A:	Well, I mean, it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,
A:	I don't know why they um, were more able than we were
A:	except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now
A:	and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to
B:	Of course, being part of the European community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,
B:	is much more necessary for them than for us.
A:	That's true,
A:	that's, that's probably true
A:	and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.
B:	There's an expression for that,
B:	With eyes on the past, backing confidently into the future.
A:	I've never heard that one,
A:	that's very nice
A:	Oh, so I'm all for the metric system and converting over
A:	and I think,
A:	I guess, my feeling is the way to do it is, is to just start giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert.
A:	Remember me getting a package of something that said one pound,
A:	this is a package of dates mind you,
A:	it's, was, presumably something you weigh fairly precisely,
A:	it said one pound
A:	and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	And, as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda
A:	cause anyone who would say, well look I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, um,
A:	every time I see something like that I think, well, that's, that's an anti-metric argument.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, uh, I, I don't think it'll, it could ever happen with, with a quick transition.
A:	You don't?
B:	No.
B:	I, I think that would be the easiest way
B:	but human nature being such as it is,  I would think it would take, probably, two or three years before people could completely cut the cord.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, oh, that's what I was thinking by quick transition,
A:	I didn't mean, you know, I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything, you know,
A:	at midnight, tonight we all switch over or anything.
B:	Did they switch?
A:	Uh, I believe so,
A:	yeah,
A:	and I think they did it overnight
A:	cause you know, you can't do it gradually.
A:	That's an example of something you can't do gradually.
B:	Well that's true.
B:	It, it has to be kind of a discreet transaction
A:	Yes,
A:	it does
A:	A quantum leap from left to right hand drive
B:	Interesting.
A:	And they,
A:	but, you know, that must have taken, uh,
A:	that was something that had to be done quickly,  you know, because of external circumstances,
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe,  or the rest of continental Europe
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know. But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm sure.
A:	Um, so I, I, I, I, I think it's essential that it's done
A:	and I think the real trick is to avoid the you know,
A:	a little more attention to human psychology
A:	and, whereas, people want round numbers
A:	and after all, the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers,  so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch
B:	Exactly,
B:	exactly.
A:	and so what the exact,
A:	the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented.
A:	Really, I think.
B:	Well, we do have the two liter soda pop bottles.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I saw that,
A:	I saw that the other day.
A:	I don't drink soda pop,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I saw a two liter soda pop bottle
A:	so, yeah,
A:	things like that are a good start
A:	and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers,  you know, two point two pounds or something. I think people will start getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one.
B:	Right.
B:	Yes.
B:	That's true.
B:	Well, sure have enjoyed our talk.
A:	Yes,
A:	well get back to what you're doing
A:	and I'll do the same.
A:	I enjoyed talking with you too.
B:	Okay,
B:	God bless
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Do you exercise a lot?
B:	Oh, it's uh, scaled back considerably.
B:	Uh, right now my exercise is pretty much limited to, uh, softball league and occasional ride on the bike,
B:	but uh, I uh, I was just recently, well, recently nine months ago, got married and bought a house
B:	so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot.
A:	Is mowing the lawn a new exercise
B:	Yeah,
B:	lawn,
B:	it's a forty year old house,
B:	so, we are doing a lot of refurbish work,
A:	Oh, my.
B:	and yeah,
B:	painting, lawn, gutters.
B:	You name it, all kinds of stuff, flower beds.
A:	I think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that's true,
B:	that's true.
B:	It's, there's always something to do
B:	and uh, and, and uh, it keeps me going.
B:	But...
A:	Well, you're, you are so far ahead of me.
A:	I used to uh, I used to walk two miles a day,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I really enjoyed it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because the two miles, went fairly quickly.
A:	I could do it in twenty-eight minutes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way,
B:	Right.
A:	but it's a lot. You know.
A:	It's not too strenuous,
A:	and I could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything,
A:	but I don't know what I did to my knee.
A:	I was crawling under a desk, hooking up a computer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I mashed it wrong, or I did something.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	And the doctor has had me on medication,
A:	and she doesn't want me to walk,
A:	she said, that's you know, while it's healing, you're going to mess it up,
A:	so I can't walk.
B:	Wow.
A:	And uh, she said, you know, the most conservative approach, you do the medicine, you do the medicine again and again, before you think of surgery.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I don't want her to think of surgery on my knee.
A:	I don't want anyone to think about that ever.
B:	No,
B:	that, that's a tough situation.
A:	That's that microscopic stuff, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh,
A:	not my kneecap.
A:	So, I'm, I'm being very good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I miss it.
A:	I really do,
A:	and I.
B:	Oh, that,
B:	it's so aggravating to uh, to have an injury like that.
B:	My wife, uh, runs or likes to run,
B:	but uh, she's,
B:	well, we moved, we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and she started running down there and all the hills.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she lasted about two weeks,
B:	and her ankles couldn't take it anymore.
B:	She was used to running, you know flat tracks and whatnot,
B:	and uh, ever since that, it's just been real difficult.
B:	It's real aggravating, because she starts in
B:	and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff. Even if she does get on flat ground,
B:	so she's kind of in the same mode.
B:	She was all ready to get back into it and start running, uh five K's, and ten K's and stuff this spring,
B:	and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape.
B:	And, when you want to do it, it's really, really aggravating.
B:	You know, it, it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise,
B:	and it's another thing to, to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health.
A:	I can you understand that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I don't really want to,
A:	I just, know I need to.
B:	Well, it's...
A:	I make myself do it
A:	and if I do it, okay,
A:	I don't love it,
A:	but I will do it.
B:	Sure.
A:	Uh, it's not anything I would want to,
A:	but I can really tell the difference, since I have not been able to walk.
A:	I have got to be so much more careful with what I do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's depressing.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it is,
B:	and you know, you, you don't well.
B:	Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not exercising,
B:	and uh, it's really, it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff,
B:	it, your body just gets used to it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I don't particularly enjoy it.
B:	Well I, I used to lift weights an awful lot, and stuff like that.
B:	I do enjoy riding bike,
B:	but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that. Uh, I, I can't say I really enjoyed it all that much,
B:	but once I got used to it, it was habit forming.
B:	It was,
B:	I felt so bad if I didn't,
B:	physically, I mean
B:	I just,
B:	my body was, was, was uh, tuned into that, that mode,
B:	and if I, if I skipped it then it kind of threw the, the whole, the whole system out of whack.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right
A:	boy,
A:	hopefully my, my knee is a hundred percent better.
A:	Maybe I can get back into it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's for sure.
A:	Let me ask you a question off the subject though.
B:	Okay.
A:	You're in, you're living in the Castle Park area?
B:	That's right.
A:	I grew up in Oak Cliff.
B:	Did you really?
A:	Yes,
A:	I did.
A:	Uh, just close to Methodist Hospital.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah.
A:	On Candy,
A:	C a n d y.
B:	Right.
A:	Oh, in fact, I lived there oh, until nineteen, late nineteen fifties.
B:	Okay,
B:	okay.
A:	And that area, is it changing back again?
A:	So many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	Uh, we're on, we're on a little street called Bison Trail.
B:	It's only about a block and a half long,
B:	but it's, it's over on the other end.
B:	It, it's over by the far edge of, uh, Stephen's Park Golf Course.
A:	Oh, I know exactly where that is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's uh,
B:	you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard?
A:	Yeah,
A:	sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we are just south of that little bridge, back-up on the hill in the trees there,
B:	and yeah,
B:	uh, our street is uh, an awful lot of retired people,
B:	but the other half,
B:	in fact, our one little block and a half there, four houses sold last summer
B:	and three sold the summer before,
B:	and everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying, and, and starting to rebuild and fix things up again
B:	and everybody is real excited.
A:	Oh, that's, that's wonderful.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That is a gorgeous, gorgeous place.
B:	Oh, it's, it's a lot of fun,
B:	the people are great.
B:	There too, we've got a real active neighborhood association.
B:	And uh, we have, well, we've got four regular parties every year
B:	and we do a neighborhood recycling program and, all that kind of stuff.
B:	So, it's a lot of fun
B:	and it is, it's a really beautiful area.
B:	And some, some of the people, uh, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those great big houses,
B:	and they're, they're getting them at a real bargain.
A:	they are.
B:	You know.
B:	They're, they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty, a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.
A:	Hm.
B:	And, uh, and they're just going to town with them.
B:	They're, people are putting in pools and, and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original, you know, nineteen thirty, nineteen forties look.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	And it, it's it's really coming around.
B:	I guess...
A:	I need to go over there and just drive around and look.
B:	It's, it's worth the trip.
A:	Oh, I'm sure it must be.
A:	I'm just,
A:	we had a lovely little house over there,
A:	it was like a two story.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, story and a half, really, because we had a basement.
B:	Okay.
A:	And the guy that built it was weird,
A:	I mean weird
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's one of these really creative houses, that I grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else.
B:	Okay.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	And I just loved the neighborhood.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I mean, everyone, everyone had houses like that.
A:	They were all completely different.
B:	I enjoyed it.
B:	I was going to go see, uh, the Billy Crystal movie, also, which was,
B:	I'm a little bit behind.
B:	I usually rent them
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I'm not familiar.
A:	Which, which Billy Crystal movie?
B:	Oh, this is the,
B:	uh, just the one, oh,
B:	gosh,
B:	it was the, uh, CITY SLICKERS,
A:	Oh, CITY SLICKERS,
B:	right.
A:	That's a real good show.
B:	Have you seen that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's great.
A:	Uh, it says a lot about, uh, uh, you know,
A:	I, I'm young,
A:	but it says a lot about middle life you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, uh, it's a really good show.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I've heard lots of good things about it
B:	and I would have, would have liked to have seen it,
B:	but I was with my wife
B:	and I figured she'd like THELMA AND LOUISE better
B:	so,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I'd heard it was really good, too
B:	so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I'm not too familiar with THELMA AND LOUISE.
A:	Uh, uh, uh, recently I, I've seen, uh, the FISHER KING.
A:	Have you seen that?
B:	No.
A:	It's a really good show.
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, has Jeff Bridges and, and, uh, Robin Williams.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, really, really good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's, there's been a, a fair number of, of pretty good movies out recently.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean it kind of runs in, in batches,
B:	I mean, for a while, sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just, I don't even, you know doesn't even sound like something I want to see.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What, what kind of movies in general do you like to watch?
A:	Uh, well, I like to be entertained once in a while
A:	but, I, I really enjoy watching a movie that, uh, where they don't really try and attract the, you know, the great audience, but rather put out a, a real good movie.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it always,
A:	my, my favorite movie of all time has been, uh, uh, THE MISSION.
A:	Did you ever see that?
B:	No,
B:	in fact, I'm not even familiar with it,
B:	I don't think.
A:	Uh, it's a, a
A:	I think it's put out by Landmark Productions, the same people who put out CHARIOTS OF FIRE.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it's a, it's a,
A:	has Robert DeNiro in it.
A:	Uh, he plays one of the main characters
A:	and, uh, it's about, uh, Jesuit community in, uh, at the Inca Falls in, in, uh, South America, Northern Argentina.
B:	Oh, uh-huh No,
A:	Uh, really, really good show.
B:	in fact, I, I, I'll, I'll look for it because I
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's something that, you know,
A:	it's, it's really stirring.
A:	The cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music.
B:	Actually yeah,
B:	my wife's from down in that region around the the, called the, the Seven Missions which are, which are right down in this, where I'm sure where it was filmed at.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, I'm sure that, that would make it worth, worth her watching.
A:	Yeah.
B:	She,
B:	my, my, uh, my movie watching has, has, severely, uh, has, has changed a lot since I got married.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah,
B:	she, she likes, uh, action movies and, uh, and, and comedies
B:	and so anything that's, has anything little, is a little, little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood is is boring to her
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, and so I, I, I, I really, I used to watch a fair number of foreign films.
B:	I used to watch a lot of, sort of, the less, the less popular films.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own.
A:	I'm much the same way.
A:	I, I, I, I have a fiance
A:	and, it, it gets very difficult to, uh, uh,
B:	Find something both of you will watch.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	She,
B:	it's funny because most women aren't really,
B:	she's sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	she really likes all these gory shoot them up films.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Keep her on the edge of her seat.
B:	I'll watch them, you know,
B:	they're kind of fun to watch in a way.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they are.
A:	Sometimes you're in the mood for it even.
B:	But, uh, so it, it, it varies,
B:	I don't seem to get, you know, as much variety these days lately as I used to.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I found when, when I get, when I get with my, uh, old college buddy, we, we usually rent, uh, good gladiator movie or two
A:	Uh, I still enjoy watching those.
A:	You can't just watch them by yourself or else, it's not bearable.
A:	But it's, it's fun to,
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	on the other hand, you know, given that my wife likes those, I, I, say, I occasionally like to watch them
B:	and, and so, uh, you know, so it's, you can always count on her to watch something like that
B:	And she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that. You know, which most, most women now won't,
A:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that's, The ones where they dub in, dub in the English.
B:	they won't come within ten feet of, All the, all the ya All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air
B:	A-cha! .
A:	That's great.
A:	Uh, uh, on foreign films did, uh, did you, did you watch,
A:	are you, uh, fluent in another language
A:	or,
B:	I
B:	yeah,
B:	I speak several, uh,
B:	but, I, I don't mind watching subtitle movies. Uh,
A:	Oh, you don't?
B:	No,
B:	I, I,
A:	I don't either.
A:	I, I feel foolish sometimes because I, I don't speak another language fluently
A:	but I do enjoy watching you know, subtitles.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, for some people, that's just, you know, that's out of the question, you know.
B:	You give it subtitles, they won't watch,
B:	Lucille Hughes.
A:	Okay,
A:	Lucille, I'm on, on .
B:	All right,
B:	and what,
A:	And our okay, our topic was,
A:	did you hear our topic?
B:	Yes.
A:	All right,
A:	basketball.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess I'm probably a lot like you.
A:	I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.
B:	Well, I certainly am too.
B:	Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.
A:	Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them.
A:	They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.
A:	You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.
A:	I feel like everyone else,
B:	Um.
A:	I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.
A:	It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final, a final team playing for all of it.
B:	Yes, sir.
A:	National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.
B:	Oh.
B:	Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, uh, coaches?
B:	Is that part of our problem?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think at this time, we're just in a, a rebuilding type of phase, you know.
A:	I think that probably be evident with the more and more, the more and more young guys they draft.
A:	But,
B:	Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,
B:	I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.
B:	I, I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and, and do.
B:	Roy, who's your next best team,
B:	or who do you like after the Mavericks?
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	I'm so much a Maverick, Maverick fan I don't know.
A:	Probably the Boston Celtics.
A:	I've just always like the Boston Celtics.
A:	They have a, they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team,
A:	and, but they're still playing good ball.
B:	Well.
A:	But I'm, I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,
A:	but, you know, I've lived in Texas since seventy-four,
A:	so being a transplanted Texan in, in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.
B:	We certainly need to support them,
B:	do we not.
A:	Yes,
A:	we do. You know.
B:	Do you go to the game?
A:	Yes,
A:	I go to a few games.
A:	I haven't been to many.
A:	I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.
A:	I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years,
A:	and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself
B:	Yes,
B:	it does
B:	I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.
A:	Oh, you bet.
B:	But, um, maybe next, maybe they can do some.
B:	I don't know,
B:	who do they need to trade?
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	It seems like Rolando Blackman and, and Harper sort of carry the team,
A:	they just,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,
A:	but, and that can really help the team,
A:	but they do that,
A:	they trade the nucleus of their power right now.
B:	Yes, sir,
B:	it seems that way to me.
B:	I, course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have
B:	and I'm not well versed on their capabilities,
B:	but we really need to do something.
A:	Well, you know, I feel like, uh, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.
A:	I like their coach.
A:	I really like a lot,
A:	and I just, I think he deserves a good break.
A:	I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club.
A:	I think Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.
B:	I really.
B:	Yes, sir.
A:	This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.
B:	And they have just done as much as they can for that man,
B:	and he apparently can't straighten his act out,
B:	so we need to, to build on something more positive than that.
A:	You bet.
A:	I think they're fools if they ever bring him back
B:	Oh, I do, too.
B:	I certainly would agree to that.
A:	Hate to put it that way.
A:	I just would not believe him any more.
B:	Well, it, um,
B:	I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances
A:	No.
B:	and I think he has gone over the limit.
A:	There's an old saying you can, you can lead a horse to water
A:	but you can't make him drink.
A:	So,
B:	That's right.
A:	And I think Tarpley's just a sad case.
B:	Well.
A:	But to be making a, a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.
B:	It is tragic.
B:	I don't, um,
B:	I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think.
A:	Oh, I think you're right.
A:	Everything has been put out of perspective now.
A:	You know, you take a, a young kid Roy Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league,
A:	and now he's probably an old age of, uh, twenty-five or six and making all that money,
B:	Yes, sir.
A:	well, that's, uh, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they, they need at that point in their life, I think.
B:	I think you're right.
B:	I believe that one,
B:	so.
A:	I think, you know, it's created by,
B:	Um, are you from this area?
A:	I'm from Dallas.
B:	Okay,
B:	I'm in Garland,
B:	so.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, I'm in Dallas right now,
B:	but I live in Garland.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, well, I don't know if you know,
B:	but Garland has got a real big recycling center that, in fact, we went to it yesterday.
B:	You drive up
B:	and you take the stuff out of your trunk,
B:	and they have different bins for the different materials, like clear, glass and colored glass and plastics
B:	and, uh, they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom.
B:	That's pretty neat.
B:	My, my daughter is four,
B:	and she's real interested in recycling.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we're, we're trying to promote that, because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away,
B:	but, we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them.
B:	Uh, does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet?
A:	Um, well, I don't know Dallas,
A:	in Richardson does.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Um, they started with newspapers and, uh, of course aluminum cans, and and bottles and plastic.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I didn't know there were different types of plastic, though.
B:	Yeah,
B:	um, like soda bottles are one one type of plastic,
B:	and milk jugs are one type of plastic.
B:	You can
B:	it's got little,
B:	most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the, with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	It's, it's just different kinds of plastics, like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And that's, that's what the different types are.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It seems to be made out of something different.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yes
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I know there's a long scientific name
B:	but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I, I don't know if they do it all over,
B:	but our Kroger does a newspaper recycling every Saturday.
B:	You can drive up,
B:	and they have one of the clerks up there, no, the bag boys out there, um, that will take the papers, newspaper out of your car,
B:	and they'll put it in their little bin,
B:	and they do the recycling,
B:	I mean, they collect the newspapers and their their plastic grocery bags which I think is pretty neat.
A:	Yeah.
A:	.
B:	That's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags
A:	That's right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Lunch bags.
B:	Yeah,
B:	in fact I have one today.
A:	Right.
B:	The only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they do.
B:	It's like, whoops, there goes my chips
A:	Yeah.
B:	okay,
B:	fine.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now, I,
B:	in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night?
A:	Uh, no.
B:	They did a program,
B:	or one of their articles was on recycling,
B:	and, uh, it was actually on a town that has a dump that they charge other cities, or towns to come in and dump their trash there.
B:	They have made so much money from that, that they built, they bought a brand new fire engine,
B:	and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough, so they bought a new, or built a new one and paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill.
A:	.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They have built up one mountain.
B:	They call it Mount Trashmore
A:	Yeah.
B:	They built up one mountain, covered it with grass, and put ski lifts on it,
B:	and in the winter they put snow on it,
B:	and they charge to ski on it.
B:	So the city gets the money from that,
B:	they built a golf course at the bottom,
B:	and they get the money from that.
A:	Wow.
B:	I's like,
B:	that's,
B:	it's a, it's, Riverview, Ohio or some place up there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it was, I thought it was a pretty neat idea.
B:	They, I mean, their city hall looked better,
B:	it was nicer than Dallas',
B:	and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city.
A:	Um.
B:	And they like the trash.
B:	So
B:	Well, okay
B:	But I thought it was pretty neat.
B:	It, it would be nice if more communities could do that,
B:	but, you have to know from beginning,
B:	and you have to have the space to do it
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they'll run out of space before long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see, that's,
B:	well they're already planning a second mountain.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, they're going to get, going to be called the Twin Peaks.
B:	I was like, uh-huh. Go back two T V shows.
B:	This, it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
B:	It,
B:	I know, I've got a two year old and a four year old,
B:	and that's,
B:	my daughter thinks that any time she sees newspapers bundled up, they're being recycled.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's like, well, no, Honey.
B:	So that, like,
B:	so that was one reason we went to show her what people did with their, their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well, yeah, you melt down the cans
A:	Right.
B:	and you make them into new things,
B:	and you get the paper all wet
B:	and you make it into new paper,
B:	and, that's fun, trying to explain that to a four year old
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	Um, so do you all go ahead,
A:	They don't even know that paper comes from trees now,
A:	so.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	she,
B:	that was her next question, was, how do you grow paper?
A:	How do you grow paper?
B:	Was like, well, from trees um. That's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And how do you grow aluminum?
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	Um.
B:	Well, let's see, um,
B:	we really don't,
B:	but. And then she was like, well, what do you do with the glass?
B:	Well, you crunch it up real small
B:	and then you melt it down.
B:	Well, what if it breaks?
B:	Well, okay,
B:	It, it, it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her.
A:	Right.
B:	But at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing,
B:	and she got our baby-sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans, because that's all she talked about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I guess what,
A:	So what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today?
B:	Well, I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the, or a lot less of the, time than they're given by the court system,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, I don't know,
B:	with the economy the way it is, I think crime can't do much but go up.
A:	No,
A:	I have to, I have to agree with you.
A:	I had occasion a couple years ago to hear the Chief of Police of Richardson, Texas speak
A:	and, you know, it's a shame a, a criminal today, not a murderer, but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and, you know, he does this and he does this for a couple of years, hides all the stash and works off of it
A:	and then when he gets caught, he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years,
A:	but he gets five days credit for every day he serves.
A:	I mean, it's like a bonus to go to jail.
B:	Right.
A:	So, subsequently, a five year sentence means he's going to be out in, uh, a year on probation.
A:	I mean, what he does, the chief said is he just merely goes back to his, his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate
A:	and, uh, when he uses up all that and spends all that money, then he, uh, starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing.
B:	Well, there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina, the average serves six weeks
A:	Now, see, that's a, you talk about, that's a crime right there.
B:	Well, see, we don't have any room in our prisons
B:	so,
A:	Well, we don't either, in Texas.
B:	They they shuttle them in and shuttle them out
B:	and they get them, get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks
B:	and then they're, they're paroled, uh, to make room for the newest criminals
B:	and it just, it, it's just really absurd.
A:	Well, it, it certainly is,
A:	and, uh, that would be a huge concern.
A:	You know, I don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system, our judiciary system and everything else.
A:	It's just, uh, it's terrible the way it is right now.
B:	I think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now, so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's
B:	or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	as far as steps to reduce crime, if it's, uh, crimes like we're just been discussing, obviously we, we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to, uh, take them off the streets,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I don't think that's going to happen because, just like you said,
A:	and our state's a good example,
A:	your state's a good example
A:	and, it's just not going to happen.
A:	As far as the murderers, and people that commit rape and things like that, I'm not sure what's right,
A:	but I know it,
A:	it's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and leers, years before you do execute them or whatever because it's, has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, to, I'm sure he gets to watch a lot of T V
A:	and I'm sure they have, uh, exercise facilities and movies
A:	and, and everything else, you know, they can have a good time in.
B:	Well, I don't know what the answer is,
B:	but I know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working
B:	so,
A:	No,
A:	it really isn't.
A:	A big,
A:	it's a big problem
A:	and hopefully something will come out of it.
A:	So, I don't know.
B:	Uh,
A:	I'm, uh I'm pretty much of a hard person,
B:	I hope so.
A:	uh, I believe in capital punishment,
A:	I mean, you know, a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone,
A:	I mean, you know, if it's just downright, outright,
B:	Oh, I definitely believe in capital punishment.
A:	Oh.
A:	You bet,
A:	I mean, that's the only way to,
B:	It's when they, it's when they're in, on death row for nineteen years that I don't, I'm kind of curious about.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	and you spend thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars to, uh, take care of them and all, you know,
A:	it's just unbelievable.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost a period of twenty years.
A:	Can you really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you,
B:	I think the, I think it's, uh, the average is eight to ten years to get in to the North Carolina Supreme Court
A:	God.
B:	and then, uh, after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States
B:	and that usually takes another four to six years.
A:	Oh, I know.
B:	So it's
A:	Meanwhile, you're living in a country club situation perhaps, you know.
B:	They're hoping,
B:	I guess they're, what they're they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did.
A:	Yes.
B:	But it's just a,
B:	we have a serious problem.
B:	We have so many problems in this state now
B:	and, and the, the thing is the, the thing,
A:	The drug problem, that's another one.
B:	The fundamental problem is the, is,
A:	our topic today?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	something about the school system here.
A:	Right,
A:	and now I'm sort of, don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage.
A:	My wife's a school teacher
A:	so
B:	Well, then, I'll, uh, I'll walk softly.
A:	No.
A:	You go right ahead because I,  have a lot of strong opinions on it, too.
A:	My wife teaches seventh grade,
A:	and, you know, there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system.
A:	I think the,
A:	I don't think the teachers get enough support, quite honestly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, for example, my wife, she has kids that are on drugs,
A:	and, of course, like everyone, she has kids that get pregnant even, even in the seventh grade.
B:	What school system does she teach in?
A:	Plano School System.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	But to give you an example, uh, you know, one of her kids will come in and he's, you could tell he was just bombed out on drugs,
A:	and, uh, she sends him to the principal's office,
A:	and the principal sends him right back, or her right back, and says, Hey, your problem, you take care of it.
A:	You're not allowed to send them home.
A:	You know, if you do that, then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever,
A:	your, your,
A:	you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day,
A:	and, it's, it's, it's a numbers game.
A:	I don't think that's right, if they're, especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning.
B:	Well, I think it's more of a,
B:	there's a bigger problem here than, uh, than discipline in the schools.
B:	I think it gets back to the, uh, parental participation into the program.
A:	Yes.
B:	Um, to give you an example, both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District,
B:	and it's a public system, however, you'd think that it was a private school, because I take it, the best teachers and the best students,
B:	they're taking top three percent that have tested out, you know, in the district and, uh, put them in this academy system,
B:	and to get into the system's very difficult.
B:	But once you're in, uh, they have, they have self-paced programs,
B:	and so you have students that want to learn
B:	and, uh, you have teachers that want to teach,
B:	and you have parents that are really interested in the children,
B:	and basically, uh, there's probably some discrimination if you want to say that uh, because most of the people that are in the academy system, uh, are Caucasian, and, because you have to test into the system.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
B:	And most of,
B:	that's not all true,
B:	but I'm saying a large percentage of them are,
B:	and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about, of these kids, uh, have college degrees, at least one parent does.
B:	And so there's,
B:	I think that, uh, that's my justification for saying that the parents that are, that are pushing their children at home, even if they don't know what their children are learning, they're, they're saying do your homework, let me see it, don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	My son had such a tough time in, uh, the school he went to
A:	but, there was through,
A:	it wasn't all the school's fault,
A:	it was his fault also,
A:	but we put him in a private school in Richardson,
A:	and that, that cost more,
A:	that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters,
A:	that was more than his college tuition was
B:	Yeah
A:	but, uh, it had to be done,
A:	at least it took care of him and, uh, threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and, uh, want to learn something.
A:	But I'll tell you what, there's a, there, there are a few faults, to say the least, in the school systems today.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think what we've done is, um, um, especially looking at, um, the South Dallas area, is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think we have that problem dealing in most areas, which is unfortunate.
B:	And, um, that also probably crosses over into business, because now, businesses also say that if you're not, don't have the proper education, uh, including, uh, exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology, if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do, uh, data base management and do, I forget all the other stuff, financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job, uh, you can't function you know.
A:	You bet.
A:	You bet.
B:	So I think that the school system proliferates over to the business world
B:	and the business world then says, we're not going to pay you, unless you have the education,
B:	and then
B:	and then, then we, what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself.
A:	Sure.
A:	Well, teachers, you know, they have a, a tough row to hoe, so to speak, they just, always fighting the system.
A:	I don't know if it's better than any,
A:	you know, we came down to Texas from the, uh, New York area,
A:	we were there for a short time,
A:	but my wife is from New York,
A:	and she was born and raised there, and educated there, college and everything,
A:	and I think, you know, the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south, I don't care where you're from.
A:	And they, they,
A:	I don't know if they learn more,
A:	but they certainly, uh, they have a tendency to learn more,
A:	and in that part of the country there is all nationalities,
A:	Alright Allen.
A:	Uh, the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know, in their, the society we live in.
A:	What do you think has occurred there?
B:	Well, I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home.
B:	That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But are, are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the, uh, oh my gosh, I can't think of the word, but for the, what they have to accept that's they are responsible for.
A:	Uh, responsibilities is what I am trying to say.
B:	Oh, I don't think so.
B:	I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.
B:	In other words, in some respects the other direction, in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals.
A:	By the same token, most, in most cases, women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries.
B:	Yes
B:	I think that's  generally speaking, pretty true.
A:	Is that right and wrong?
B:	And I think that's what we really ought to look at that, going is, if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay.
A:	Yes.
B:	And that, uh, they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I don't think that we have gotten there yet.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years?
A:	Any individual thing
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	or is it just a general switch over?
B:	I think it's generally that switch over.
B:	And, and I think that switch over has been more in the work force.
B:	I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force.
B:	I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them, on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So they have one and three quarters jobs now. Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household.
A:	So do you think that is going to be uh, difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years?
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think also in terms of parenting.
B:	I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting
B:	and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units.
A:	Well, do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation, specifically?
B:	Well, I, I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
B:	and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be
B:	and I want to go back and do something else.
B:	I think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Also, much of it is driven by economics right now.
A:	Yes.
B:	People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in.
A:	Well, I actually,
A:	a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the people.
A:	Well, how do you feel about women in, uh, armed services?
B:	Well, I think they ought to have the right.
B:	I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to or my wife and my daughter going into combat
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I have problems with men doing that
B:	and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it.
A:	Um.
B:	It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I somehow can't do that
A:	I, was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home, safe, secure, and made happy
A:	and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money, bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
A:	and it, it really still bothers me.
A:	I spent plenty of years in the service,
A:	but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around.
A:	I mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak.
B:	I agree.
A:	It puts them in a very bad situation.
A:	I, I really don't go for that.
B:	I think one of the other things that concern, has concerned me a little bit,
B:	and I think I see some change in attitudes there.
B:	My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there's, uh, has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force, uh, fulfilling herself.
A:	Yep.
A:	and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going
B:	And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do, that's acceptable.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If they chose to go into the work force that's okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If they chose not to, that's acceptable.
A:	And if they go into the work force, they should be treated as nicely  as, as well as a man or any other person.
B:	As equals.
A:	And, uh, not,
B:	All right.
A:	Okay,
A:	so what do you think of the Giants?
B:	Uh, I like the Giants.
B:	They got, uh,
B:	I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe, maybe three years ago really
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, uh, but I, I just like the Giants.
B:	I don't, I don't know why.
B:	I really got into them.
B:	I read, uh, Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah
B:	and,
A:	wasn't that something of him.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that was incredible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's really a,
A:	really proud of him though, the way he's, you know.
B:	The way he handled that entire situation, there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	really, you know.
B:	But, I just think the Giants have a good team.
B:	They, they got all, you know,
B:	they're, they're, they're real balanced out.
B:	They got real good pitching,
B:	and they got the hitting to go along with it.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they just they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push them over the top, you know.
B:	I don't really know what it is,
B:	but, but every team that's, that's really good seems,
B:	you know, like the A had, they had, they just had it all that one year.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um I was mostly an A fan, you know.
A:	I had been to more games at the A than I have in the Giants because, uh, I lived in Oakland you know, for some time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, you know, you  good and the bad
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	but. It's, it's kind of hard.
B:	I still, basically, the, the,
B:	me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere,
B:	I mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams,
B:	but since,
B:	me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams,
B:	so we, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	about, about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo.
B:	We play R B I baseball on Nintendo
B:	so. So that's just, you know, that's small town trying to make it through the not being around it really,
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	but.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	Well, I prefer uh, football over baseball,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so do I,
B:	but baseball is still
A:	it's.
B:	you got, you got to do something when football ain't on.
B:	So
A:	So, hot dogs, baseball and apple pie. Huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
B:	This is America,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um.
B:	But.
A:	So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams?
B:	Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say.
B:	I haven't really, really,
B:	you have to just keep up with everything in the season.
B:	It's kind of hard to do,
B:	at least, you know,  you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and, and all that,
A:	I know.
B:	but, like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, the Giants are.
B:	They just,
B:	I don't,
B:	yeah
B:	I don't really know about the A
B:	They kind of.
A:	Yeah,
A:	makes you sick, doesn't it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	You hear what, you hear what, you hear what he did.
A:	Yes.
B:	He ramming his wife's car,
B:	and I was like, yeah.
A:	He's like a little bitty kid, huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's just a, a, a little boy with a lot of money.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah
B:	That's just,
B:	you know, but.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I guess the Giants or, might move away from San Francisco, it sounds like.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've heard, I've heard talk about that.
A:	You know, uh, they won't be that far away,
A:	but San Francisco will be hurting, anyhow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're not going to be happy about it.
A:	You know.
B:	But I hope they can do good.
B:	I mean, that's just,
B:	I think they're a good team. That just need that one, one little thing to push them over.
B:	I don't know exactly what it is.
B:	They got,
B:	they're pretty balanced out all the way through.
B:	It just might be the drive, you know more than anything else,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they just, they probably just need something to push them because I, that's, that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back, is the ambition to do it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Or somebody basically,
B:	maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it.
B:	Maybe that's what, you know, that's what some teams need.
B:	Look at the Twins going from worst to first.
A:	I know, isn't that something
B:	Yeah,
B:	my roommate my roommate's a Twins fan, for forever,
A:	I couldn't believe that, huh.
B:	so, he had his year this year,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I just, it.
B:	We got we, we got into that a whole bunch.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	That was a, that was a series to remember, for sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I saw all seven games of that,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I couldn't believe that, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't, uh,
A:	there was Braves in that chanting that they had.
A:	That would drive you up a wall.
B:	Yeah
B:	they,
B:	every team with the Indians been doing that now.
A:	You know.
B:	I can't figure out why.
B:	You have to figure out why they're all doing that, I'm like, it's doesn't work, it's obvious it doesn't work because the, you know the Braves, Braves didn't win,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, you're right
B:	so, uh, why keep on doing something that didn't work,
B:	but I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I was, I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball,
B:	and I get a woman's voice.
B:	I was, I was, I was thinking, uh-huh,
B:	I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car,
B:	so.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I got, I called, got a call the other night about, uh, fixing your automobile up,
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Well, baseball's baseball.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	It's kind of,
B:	I don't know, it's kind of odd they pick,
B:	do you pick the topic or does the computer?
A:	No,
A:	uh, they give you a list of things that you want,
A:	Uh, Greg,
A:	uh, I, I'm not familiar.
A:	I think, uh, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we do have the death penalty here.
B:	It's not exercised very often,
B:	but we do have it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I believe it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,
B:	but, uh seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that, that the person just, I feel, doesn't deserve to live, doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in, in prison for life.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,
B:	but just seems like in some cases that it's a, it's a good policy.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I, I tend to agree with you,
A:	uh, I've changed my views over, uh, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest.
A:	Uh, uh, when I was in when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, I thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh,
A:	you know, that
A:	the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.
B:	Right.
A:	But the, uh, the more,
A:	now I live in downtown Dallas,
A:	and I, uh, you know, I've seen, uh, I've seen cases on, in the news and all where, where, you know, uh, a, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	I think that maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder.
B:	That's a, that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it seems sensible and failsafe.
A:	I, I, uh, I don't,
A:	you know, not completely failsafe,
A:	but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh I also, uh,
A:	to tell you how liberal I have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen, uh, I believe it that, uh, big time drug importers, like, uh, say Noriega for example that these people need to be, uh, eliminated, uh from society,
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think, I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure
B:	Yeah,
B:	you're, you're right there.
B:	Uh, I
B:	basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that I just, you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
A:	Right.
B:	so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I, I'm all in favor of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, uh, do you, uh,
A:	are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?
B:	Well, I, I really don't know on that question.
B:	It just seems like,
B:	for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society.
B:	I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,
B:	so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
A:	Right.
B:	and I think that, that he should not be allowed to live,
B:	but, you know, then you're kind of playing God which is never a good thing to do.
A:	That's true,
A:	yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that I can think of.
B:	I, I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or serial killers
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, I don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that.
B:	I think that they're, they're operating on a more,
B:	I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,
B:	but I don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because they're feeding our consumer needs.
A:	Right.
A:	Sure,
A:	yeah,
A:	I understand, I understand your point.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with Dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that I think it's Ohio, uh, gets to try him next
A:	and they do have the death penalty.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, uh, that was a curious case.
A:	I.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is very curious.
A:	Uh, uh, something is sort of nightmarish to say the least.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's, that's right.
A:	Uh, well, here in Texas we, uh,
A:	I think even, even this last week, last week they had another, they, uh,
A:	you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection, uh, uh,
A:	Steve, this is,
A:	like I mentioned, Brian and I guess we're going to want to be talking about child care.
A:	Uh, do you have any experience in, uh, finding child care?
B:	Well, ourselves, we have I guess never had to look for child care.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen.
B:	But, uh, and so, you know, you go back those many years and, uh, we didn't do it very much.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We, I guess, we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at, uh, two family income at the time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And our kids were older.
B:	But I've had to deal with, uh, you know, friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, so it,
B:	my involvement hasn't been direct
B:	but still have been, you know, certainly exposed to criteria people are using.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Well, uh, we're kind of lucky.
A:	I, I'm, uh, I'm working.
A:	My wife isn't working
A:	and she is taking care of the kids also.
A:	And, and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice.
A:	But I do have, like you mentioned, a lot of friends, a lot of, uh, co-workers and associates that are looking for child care
A:	and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care. Uh, what kind of, you know, uh, guidance counselor to student or, you know, uh, adult to child relationship.
A:	How many
B:	Right.
A:	you know, you don't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult.
A:	Then  uh, something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to, uh, accommodate or take care of the kids very well.
B:	Right.
B:	Right
A:	And, uh, they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time.
A:	So, you know, depends also upon the, the level of the child.
A:	We, uh, we, uh, take a very close look at finding a, a preschool, a good preschool for our kid.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I kind of relate that to that in, in making sure that the, the, uh, teachers are very well educated themselves. They have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them.
A:	And it's very important, I feel, uh, that the kids interact with other children also.
A:	It's a, it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and, uh, get to know and work with kids.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. I don't know. I, I guess we're kind of in the same boat.
A:	We haven't had to look very carefully for child care.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I kind of think that, uh, you know, some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But even, you know, here. I guess we have in one sense two forms of, uh, child care.
B:	There's where individuals will in one, primarily babysit children in their own home.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to, maybe, seven or eight children.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And then otherwise, there will be
B:	the majority are co-operative day-cares.
B:	Uh, people form a co-op and, uh, parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours.
B:	Frequently, they will hire staff to be at the day-care
B:	and the emphasis is primarily, uh, someplace for the children to be.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, at the same time, there's some fairly good training programs and, and some of them formal two year programs.
A:	Right,
A:	right
B:	Uh, so that,
B:	you know, there is some definite, uh, creative play, good social interaction, that kind of thing.
A:	I think it's, uh, important. Like you mentioned, that's a good idea on the, uh, parent co-op because, uh, I'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids
A:	and I don't want to just take them to somebody I pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere.
A:	I want to trust the people
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, you know, you hear in the you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of, of people that, you know, don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of,
A:	so. And hope to never get into that situation where we have to, have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children.
A:	And hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know, we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I guess, you know, it, are,
B:	it's, uh, typically, uh, whether it's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
B:	and it's not, and it's more of a group home rather than  actually day-care type of facility.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true,
A:	that's true.
B:	Uh
A:	Well, Steven, it's been,
A:	Well, I'm,
A:	are you there?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	I'm sure that I probably, uh, prescribe to different magazines ones that you do
B:	Different set
A:	Uh, I also take BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like that.
A:	And then, uh, my husband, he just, uh, subscribed to a wood,
A:	he just started a woodwork
A:	so he just sent away to get some woodworking books.
B:	Oh.
A:	So what kind do you, uh, get?
B:	Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but beyond that, uh, lately I've been reading,
B:	I've always liked the NEW YORKER.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	my  wife also gets a lot of the food magazines. BON APPETITE, and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET.
A:	Is it,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I used to take that.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And she still likes to get TIME which I've never liked very much
A:	Yeah.
B:	but she seems to.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't,
A:	I,
A:	if I, you know, if I happen to find it, I'll go ahead and read it someplace, you know, if I'm in a doctor's office or something like that
A:	but other than that I never, I never liked that really.
B:	Do you read a newspaper?
A:	I read my newspaper.
A:	I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper  to get here, you know.
B:	Yeah.  larger computer ones.
A:	In fact, it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news
B:	I haven't bought it now for about eight years.
B:	But when I used to get it, it was about five hundred pages, about three hundred of them advertising.
A:	Huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	That, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, you know, some of the get ridiculous.
B:	TRAVEL AND LEISURE, all of the AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others, uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for
B:	and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I, I only, you know, subscribe to the things I'm interested in.
A:	I used to be into coin collecting
A:	so I used to get the coin magazine, the paper actually is what it was, you know.
A:	I used to get that.
A:	So now that I'm into dolls, that's about all I really, really want, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have you ever, uh, read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time?
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
A:	Uh, I think they're interesting.
B:	But not worth it.
A:	Yeah
B:	I, I've always had this,
B:	one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or, or what's going on
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I, like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, uh, organization magazines
B:	and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective.
B:	Uh, you know, their major interest is in commissions
B:	and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines.
B:	Their major talk is about, you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is
B:	and it gives you a different perspective on what people do.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well those travel magazines, are that, more or less, show you different countries that you could go to
A:	or,
B:	Uh, some of them.
B:	The, the general travel magazines do.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I, I usually just read through the sections on, on domestic stuff.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about.
B:	No.
A:	Uh, I don't take anymore than that
B:	Yeah.
B:	I don't take much more in myself.
A:	You know, so.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well I guess that will be it then
A:	and,
B:	Okay,
B:	nice talking to you.
A:	Been on the line for awhile.
A:	I almost forgot what the topic was.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh, based,
A:	Uh, but I know what it is.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Good.
A:	Uh, let me see.
A:	I, I, I, I, I'm kind of,
A:	I don't,
A:	you know, I'm, I'm kind of in the middle.
A:	I, I think it's a great idea
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but when it comes to me, it's like, almost an insult, you know,
A:	so it's
A:	I, I've come from the teaching field.
B:	Right.
B:	So do I
A:	So, so it's just like I don't know. I, I guess, I guess I'd have to go with, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I, I, I would, I would probably go for, for going ahead and doing it, you know. If it's got to be done for everyone.
B:	Right.
B:	I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company, it should be random testing, it should be for everybody.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot easier
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know, I come from the teaching field too
B:	and it sort of, uh,
B:	it's a pro and a con
B:	I don't know where to stand on it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm more or less, if they told me I had to well then fine,
B:	but  if, you know, if they made me then I'd probably,
A:	Yeah.
B:	if I had my druthers I'd probably say well no
B:	you know just this,
A:	Yeah.
A:	You kind of goes into your privacy
A:	and you know, but I guess if they,
B:	Right.
A:	you know, you know, there's, uh,
A:	I guess there's some companies that aren't, that are doing it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it, it seems to be working out
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, anybody who, uh, gee, is, you know, doesn't accept the rehab program then they're, more or less, getting laid off.
A:	See, that's hard.
B:	that's a,
B:	it's really weird issue.
B:	I'm sort of  on the fence about it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I,
B:	you know, that, that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow.
B:	Oh, we can get you into a drug program.
B:	But then you wear that stigma you know
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	Then I kind of hear it goes into like, uh,
B:	Right.
B:	Anything with a,
B:	you know, if you drink a lot of caffeine or,
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	somebody was saying, telling me if you drink it in, you know, an awful lot of caffeine, that that can show up as a positive test.
A:	Um.
B:	I know I'm an epileptic
B:	so I'd probably test positive and  and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system, you know
A:	Yeah.
A:	See things like that
A:	so,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, it's very personal.
B:	I wouldn't want to have it disclosed because  then I'd always wonder if they fired me, you know, why did you fire me
A:	See that's,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's where I kind of get into,
A:	cause it kind of gets into your personal life, you know.
A:	And what's kind of next.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The what?
B:	Orwell.
A:	Huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I
B:	I'd hate to have to,
B:	if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah
A:	Right.
B:	But I can understand why they need it with all the, you know, train accidents and everything else.
A:	So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually?
A:	I kind of think they will.
B:	I think they will too because, uh, you know, it's just going to follow.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know. I, we haven't had any of it in our school system.
B:	So, uh, you know  hopefully, we won't
A:	Yeah.
A:	We haven't either.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I, I, I just kind of think it's heading that way though, you know. It's just, because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff
A:	and I just I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way.
B:	Right.
B:	Well and eventually it's going to be not only the
B:	you know, the kids are  going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids.
A:	Right.
B:	And then they, you know, caught everybody.
A:	Yeah
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, I haven't been in this situation yet
A:	You know, my, my parents are not quite at that age yet,
A:	so I haven't,
B:	They're not quite elderly, huh
A:	No.
A:	So I haven't, uh, really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother
A:	but, uh but that's really about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How about you?
A:	Have you been in that situation yet?
B:	Uh, not for my parents.
B:	But I, I was around, uh, two sets of grandparents, uh, quite a bit,
B:	we, we put one, I put one grandfather in a rest home
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that killed him
A:	Did it really?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	kind of.
B:	Well, there was some other things involved
B:	but it,
B:	before he was really active
B:	and the,
B:	there was some,
B:	you know, he lost his drivers license
B:	and I couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things
B:	and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And he just kind of became a vegetable and died.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	So  but that was a long time ago.
A:	That's sad.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That was, uh, back in like seventy-three.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, uh, I think the way they did things were a lot different back then.
A:	I'm sure they were.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, my grandmother, his, his wife uh, we also put her in a rest home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She was in a rest home
B:	and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and, uh, had a physical, had a good physical therapist at that place
B:	and  they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself
A:	Ah.
B:	and so  she was able to come back home
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then she had to go back in a couple of times,
A:	Oh.
B:	but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up.
A:	Um.
B:	And they got her going again.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I guess as far as looking, do things with them and treat them, treat like they're ,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm sure it's, it's expensive.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It, it is
A:	Yeah.
B:	It is expensive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	My, my grandmother is not in a nursing home
A:	but she's in a
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	oh they're like, uh, they're apartments for senior citizens
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they have, uh, where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
A:	and she, she, she really does love that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she's just wondering well  what's going to happen to me
B:	When she can't take care of herself.
A:	and, and I,
A:	you know, it's, I guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that,
A:	but you know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now
A:	she's kind of asking questions about what, well what's going to happen, this can't last forever
A:	and so.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Does she have a,
B:	is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to
A:	Yeah.
B:	or she can go down to the cafeteria?
A:	Yeah,
A:	she can
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	In fact, I ,
A:	because I, I remember her, in her letters, telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat,
A:	so I'm assuming it's something like that too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I really like that concept.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They've, they have a few of those, well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah
B:	and, you know, couples can,
B:	you know, husband and wife can, can live there too or, or whatever.
B:	I,
B:	and, and then, and yet they have their, their friendships and relationships and the, in you know, of getting together and eating together and all of that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I, I think it really takes, uh, you know, looking more at the people than even really the facilities.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she lives by herself too.
A:	She seems to like it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, my husband's grandmother is,
A:	well, she lives, she lives in a house on her own
A:	and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that
A:	but, she has her own home
A:	and she's doing really well.
A:	I'm really proud of her.
A:	She's doing really well,
A:	so we haven't had to do anything,
A:	but then again, she has a lot of support
A:	so I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yes.
B:	Well, I, I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, you know, a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's, it's almost like
B:	that, you know, they say putting them out to pasture
B:	and some, some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active.
A:	Yeah
B:	They, they wanted to do things.
B:	They didn't, you know, they didn't want to go down and play bingo or, uh, you know, play with the oranges
B:	Okay, I guess we're on.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Central America, have you ever lived in Central America.
A:	I wasn't in Central America
A:	but, uh, talking about Latin America, I kind of, I consider Latin America to include Central and South America
A:	and I did live in, uh, San Polo Brazil for four years.
B:	Do you, do you think that, that we should have given up the Panama Canal?
A:	Uh, realistically, I,
A:	yes,
A:	I don't see the, the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not, not really big enough to, uh, accommodate the, the shipping that it once did
A:	and, uh, maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however, I think, we're certainly justified in, uh, our actions dealing with, uh, Noriega in this ...
B:	Well, there are those that, that, that think that, that, that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the military.
B:	Interestingly enough my father was, who was in World War One, and as, uh, as a civil engineer they, they, they offered him a commission as a captain if he would, uh, go in and, and, uh, help with the defenses of the Panama Canal.
B:	He had worked for United Fruit Company there,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they, uh, they, in fact, they had,
B:	this was in the, the late twenties
B:	and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
B:	and, uh, he turned them down.
B:	It, it's interesting that, that most people don't realize how small the canal is.
B:	Have you ever been there?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't.
B:	It's, it's really,
B:	I, I haven't been there,
B:	I've been to, been to Salvador
B:	and, and, uh, in fact, we went back to visit some friends of, of my fathers, that we went in fifty-seven I guess.
B:	And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged quite, quite easily.
B:	The thing I find interesting, though, is that, uh, is the whole colonial approach
B:	and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we support, uh,
B:	you know, when they thought, uh, they thought that Nicaragua, if you gave them a free election, they would vote for the,
B:	Will you, uh,
B:	did you ever studied the, the political makeup there, in, in, in Nicaragua.
A:	I have a, a little bit,
A:	I can't say that I'm, I would be an, an expert on, on the region,
A:	but, uh, certainly, uh, I, it, it gets, it there,
A:	your,
A:	you've got this, this toss up
A:	or not, not so much a toss up but a, a dilemma when, when you want a country to have its, its, um, own, uh, dominion, or its free rein over its, its own people.
A:	and now we're, we're in this dilemma over, uh, United States is, believes in democracy and, and self determination, where
A:	but that
A:	on the other hand we believe in self preservation and, uh, agree with the, or, not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about, uh, Soviet influence in, in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only, you, we used to see spheres
A:	but now we're in a situation where the United States is, looks like we're it now.
B:	Well the interesting part about it is that, if, realistically it was economic.
B:	I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal
B:	but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua,
B:	uh, and, uh, there were, uh, there's a big, there's a big lake,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua,
B:	but the, the United States, uh, had some,
B:	and I've forgotten what the political influence was
B:	but there were economic ties then.
B:	The issue of, of
B:	if, if it's in the economic interest of the United States, uh, do we go in and, and prevail
B:	and, and, uh, in other words do we make the world safe for democracy,
A:	Right.
B:	but if there's no economic benefit,
B:	and I think particularly if you're, if you're looking at the, at the, at the peasant, uh, whether he's in Central America, regardless of where he is, is his life, is his life better off under communism or, or uh, or Democratic government.
B:	You look at Salvador where the,
A:	Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his, uh, his family.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and the question is, does the government make a difference.
B:	If they'll mostly leave him alone, uh,
B:	and I think that's the difficulty they, that, that we have that, uh, it, it reality doesn't make, uh, doesn't make any difference if he has no income.
B:	And apparently even some of our alleged, uh, Central American leaders that, uh, are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things,
B:	so it's, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well,
A:	in looking,
A:	if you look at the region in, in, uh,
A:	to their detriment they came from, uh, this, uh, hundreds of years of Spanish control
A:	and the, and the Spaniards have, uh, horrible history of corrupt, uh, government, greedy, uh, rulers who have been, uh, manipulating, manipulating their public for their own, their own good.
A:	I mean, if you go back to the kings and, and the, the conquistadors coming in and, and the incredibly horrible things they did to the, uh, the native tribes,
A:	I mean they make, uh, they make the things that Custer did look like, uh, like trivial.
A:	And, uh, you get,
B:	It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the exploitation
B:	and, and, and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them
B:	and, and Americans have, uh, have a pretty good reputation of exploiting,
B:	you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and, and took it.
A:	Oh, absolutely
A:	and, you know we set up ...
B:	and we stole it fair and square,
A:	An,
A:	I mean, Ted, Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation, speak softly and carry a big stick for, uh, for nothing
A:	and, uh,
A:	Right.
B:	what's the, what's America's role there
B:	and it, it, uh,
B:	with, with other things going on, it, it seems to have lessened,
B:	but you've still got, uh, Cuba that accepts, exerts some influence.
A:	The only, the only thing I see about Cuba though, is, uh, after Fidel Castro dies, I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore.
A:	I, I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him.
B:	Well, when you take a, a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class excuse me,
B:	and that, uh,
B:	you know, having a, a lot of difficulty, uh, surviving, uh, the question is would they, you know, would they be better off under communism.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I wouldn't, don't know that I would advocate communism
B:	but, uh, the question is can, uh, can you, can, uh, can a democracy, uh, afford the,
B:	it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S, is that, that's essentially an underclass
A:	Right.
B:	and when you get enough of them, uh, you know communism would feed them all.
A:	well, I, I don't know if maybe communism is the right, the right word for it
A:	but what we would,
A:	there would have to be some kind of,
A:	there, there may be a point at which, at which, you've, uh, you might want to consider some kind of socialistic, uh, organization or socialistic set up to, to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy.
B:	Well that,
B:	yeah,
B:	if the guys got some incentive,
B:	if he's got, uh,
B:	you know, if he, if he can raise enough, uh, coffee and bananas to, uh, where he's got something to protect,
B:	other, you know,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	whether he can export or at least, uh, set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest.
A:	But cocoa leaves sell real well right now, it seems,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	I don't,
A:	it's going to be hard to, um,
A:	we,
A:	if you, you,
A:	that, that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage, uh, or to make, to make him growing bananas profitable again, I mean.
B:	Yes,
B:	but the, but the question is, you know, if somebody offered you, you know, a thousand dollars a day to, to grow something in your backyard, would you do it.
A:	Right.
B:	Well not that we could be bought,
B:	but, uh,
A:	I've got to watch what I say here,
A:	I never know when the D I A may be, uh, listening on my phone
B:	Well of course, everything we're saying is being recorded
B:	and ...
A:	Right,
B:	Of course,
B:	of course.
A:	yeah,
A:	it's tempting,
A:	it's got to be, it's got to be horribly tempting for those, those peasants.
B:	Particularly, if you're hungry.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	you,
A:	it's not, it's not just a matter of, uh, of having an extra car or having a better car, this is a matter for them of, of feeding themselves their wife and their family
A:	and, and you,
A:	there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family
A:	and there's dishonor in not being able to do it
A:	and ...
B:	Uh, starving to death is not a, not a whole lot of fun either
B:	and, that,
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In reality, I think, what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves,
B:	not that they,
B:	I'm, I'm not sure the Catholic church is, is, is particularly political
B:	but, you know, if ...
A:	Right.
A:	Yes,
A:	um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.
B:	I was a resident, although very young of the of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.
B:	Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.
B:	Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh,
B:	and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.
B:	What is your situation?
A:	Well, I'm, I guess I don't have such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.
A:	Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.
A:	Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.
A:	However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo.
A:	I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.
A:	I did Peace Corps training there.
B:	Oh that's very interesting.
A:	And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student
A:	and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California
A:	and so the Spanish was no problem.
A:	Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely
A:	and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.
A:	I have,
A:	actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico
A:	and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.
B:	Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid
B:	or,
A:	Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,
A:	you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.
A:	I've live abroad most of my life,
A:	so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.
A:	I lived actually in Lebanon,
A:	so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.
A:	So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.
A:	I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.
B:	I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi
B:	or,
A:	I think so.
B:	Okay,
B:	that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.
B:	Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy.
B:	I don't, I don't know that the the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.
B:	Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.
B:	But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax.
B:	I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.
B:	How do you feel, though, about,
B:	well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,
B:	but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student
B:	and my parents were in the military at the time
B:	so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.
B:	I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.
B:	The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.
A:	Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if,
A:	I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I see what you mean,
B:	so that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.
B:	Uh, there,
B:	I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.
B:	Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,
B:	I,
B:	and I'm thinking in terms of education.
B:	But then again each state sets its own
B:	and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.
B:	Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization
B:	and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country
B:	so,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, well actually I
A:	one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.
A:	So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well that's interesting too.
B:	Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.
A:	I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.
B:	And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.
B:	So I'm I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood.
A:	Well that's interesting.
A:	Right.
A:	What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.
B:	I think I would be troubled,
B:	I suspect, I believe that any of our states,
B:	and I,
B:	constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.
B:	Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.
B:	I would be bothered by that.
B:	I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths
B:	and that's the, the, the melting pot.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,
B:	but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past
B:	and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.
B:	Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make
B:	and I think that that they would need to reassess that.
B:	Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California
A:	and I didn't have any problem with my students
A:	but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school
A:	and he can't speak a word.
B:	Um.
A:	And so, obviously it didn't work in California.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,
A:	Right.
B:	and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.
A:	Right.
B:	But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Well I think we have gone to time
B:	and I appreciate your having called.
A:	Okay,
A:	well thank you very much.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Bye,
A:	bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	So what are your opinions on it?
B:	Well, let me preface it.
B:	I'm a,
B:	I was a staff officer in Vietnam, in sixty-nine and seventy
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm in active reserve now,
B:	so, uh, I'm probably not going to have the you think I would have.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's,
B:	I was an interesting, in that I think that he gave the American people some, uh, uh, a sense of the fact that, that, uh, wars are really run by politicians. *I It??
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I,
B:	are you old enough to remember the war?
A:	not much.
A:	I'm twenty-eight,
A:	so. No.
A:	I really don't remember anything about it.
A:	I guess I was about ten when it ended.
A:	Right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I was born in sixty-two,
A:	so when did it end?
B:	Well, December seventy-two, was when we bombed North Vietnam, and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three, in that, in that time frame.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because, I was ten,
A:	and I don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in, great detail.
B:	I think, the, the significant thing is, is today did, did you, uh, did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf?
A:	No.
A:	I didn't,
A:	but I, I did read the book.
A:	I
A:	do
A:	I have six years of college,
A:	so I did read, and study about the Vietnam war though.
A:	So I am pretty
A:	you know, I'm more,
B:	Well, what's your perspective on it?
A:	familiar with it than,
A:	Mine.
A:	I think, uh, I think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation, and that, I think it was the right thing to do, to try and not to take away, to, you know, just leave their freedoms there and to, you know, get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to.
A:	I don't, I don't know, I don't really,
A:	I'm tired of pacifist though, *pacifist pacifists?
A:	see on the other hand, I'm a
A:	I'm really struggling with it.
A:	and I believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein, or the North Vietnamese,
A:	but it's in spiritual kingdoms, and that the real warfare is done, you know, in your prayer closet, on your knees.
A:	So, in a way, in a sense I'm a pacifist,
B:	Yes.
A:	I don't think just lay back and not do anything.
A:	I think, lets go to war, *lets let's
A:	but let's go to war praying,
A:	and let's go to war for that way
A:	so,
B:	Well, well, the difficulty I have, is that, uh, are we our neighbor's keepers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, this is what I find particularly difficult in that, uh, if we see injustice, and weather it's in a, uh, you know, Chicago, or, uh, *typo weather whether or, or Dallas, I, I think if we see it, you know, we see John Wiley Price hollering injustice, I think that's wrong.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now the question is, is was there injustice in Vietnam,
B:	or was, there injust in Iraq Kuwait, *typo injustice?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the difficult, I, point is, is to, where do we step in,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and the, the other part is, that the, the, when, when your, when your, when your looking at Vietnam, and you say, well, is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it. *3 typos your you're
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Still have a problem with, uh,
A:	you know, I haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this,
A:	but, and I know other Christians would disagree with me.
A:	My husband and I, are kind of not even in agreement on this,
A:	but we don't fight over it or anything,
A:	but, you know, how can,
A:	you know, the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you,
A:	and it's like, be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, kind,
A:	so it's like how can you,
A:	I don't know, for me,
A:	I don't know, you know, I can't say that I agree with Vietnam, because how can you be gentle unto all men, and, and then shoot them.
A:	So,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	could you stand there and watch them beat that guy.
B:	If your brother or your sister were being beaten, by the authorities do we step in?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well. In some cases we would,
B:	and I, I think that's what makes it so difficult.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is a difficult thing.
A:	But then, vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord,
A:	and I will pay.
A:	So, I think God is ultimately in charge of what goes on,
A:	and I know, like now in China he did all these terrible things, *probably Mao
A:	and they were terrible,
A:	and he was going to be accountable for them,
A:	and, but if you look back, and you say wait a minute, while he was in power, he built roads, he put in all the temples, he, he unified the Chinese language.
A:	It was impossible for missionaries to do, accomplish anything in China because of all that,
A:	and so even in North and South Vietnam, I bet you'd see the same thing, and that now he builds roads
A:	so, then it
A:	and then he dropped dead, twenty-five years premature, he dropped dead,
A:	and so something good did come out of that, in that now, you see what I mean, if like now,
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, but the other, the other difficulty is, is that it's just, if, if you take the to, to feed my sheep and the question is, who are my sheep,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the idea, do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry.
A:	Well. Bless your enemies, if your enemy is hungry, feed him,
A:	if he, if he needs your, asks for your shirt, give him your coat also.
A:	So, if the, the, the, the South Vietnamese, they asked us to help them.
A:	Right?
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh, they did,
B:	but, I think the biggest difficulty is, is that when your at an economy like South Vietnam, well, the, then reality, uh, the, the poor farmer, the poor rice farmer, was going to pay taxes *your you're
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the question is, who was he going to pay it to?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, the communists are the, all alleged democrats. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	democratic formed government,
B:	and I, I think that's, I think, I think, uh, that's a little, was a difficult part, there,
B:	and, and, I,
B:	we didn't understand the culture.
B:	We couldn't, uh,
B:	we had, uh, we had a, a young lady that was fourteen that worked on our, in the unit I was commander of, that appeared to be eight or nine years old,
B:	and, and the people looked like children
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, you couldn't imagine that one would, would, would conceal a bomb and and do these kind of things.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think socially, it really destroyed a lot of the people that, that went over and saw these people.
B:	You just couldn't believe that they would, that they would be mean, and, and, and, and drop bombs and kill people,
B:	and then we would turn around and, and nay palm them, you know, *typo napalm
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	if
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think there was a lot of, a lot of tearing of emotions,
B:	and I think that if anything, that, when he was saying the idea that we learned, we we learned a lot from Vietnam
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	now, it was, it was in general, bad,
B:	but, and, I don't know, the problem is now,
B:	I'm, I'm concerned a little bit, that now that the gulf war is on, that we're going,
B:	I think it was a good war,
B:	and it was okay to go beat up on people,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that, I think we need to, a little more justice at home.
B:	I'm not sure how we get that,
B:	wonder if there's a connection there,
B:	but ,
A:	Yeah.
A:	But then again, yeah,
A:	I'd say it is wrong to
A:	and I'm not saying president Bush made the wrong decision.
A:	I think I'm lacking in my,
A:	I don't think I can come to a complete conclusion on how I feel about the Vietnam war, because I'm going to interpret that, through the Bible,
A:	and I've kind of always,
A:	I've been a Christian five years,
A:	and I've kind of avoided that, that, those, the war things, and how God approaches that because I think it's just now coming up to where I really feel like I need to, come, you know, need to decide, what I feel.
B:	Well, the difficulty is
B:	and that was part of the problem, when they went into the promise land, * should be promised land that they, that they, uh, they didn't destroy everybody,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	They left a woman, and a child, and a, the sheep.
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, and you,
B:	I think that's one of those things when we get to heaven we're going to ask God
A:	I know.
B:	Why did you do it that way
A:	But then again, though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law, you know what I'm saying,
A:	like, so he didn't just say, don't kill your, don't kill your enemies,
A:	but, not only don't kill them, bless them.
A:	What can we do to rectify this situation,
A:	and that God would move in that sovereignly,
A:	and he would get the glory, though, no king, no,
A:	Bush wouldn't, because it wouldn't make any sense, you know what are I'm saying?
B:	Yeah.
A:	It would look absolutely, ridiculously stupid,
A:	but it would work out, because, if you follow the scriptural principals, it's going to work out, because those are, that's the best way to do it, you know, *spelling = principle
A:	but the thing is, is that then God gets the glory, not a president, not a king,
A:	and I think that's a problem for a lot of politicians, is they want the glory.
B:	Well, and, I, I,
B:	and even if the, even at the local level, when somebody's assaulted what do you do, turn the other cheek?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, I believe, personally,
A:	I
A:	I I woman always says, my husband always goes three that, I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if the one, if somebody broke in my house, I would pray that I would have this faith, to, to take authority over that,
A:	and I know people that have done that.
A:	I mean, I know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes, and just say I bind you in Jesus name,
A:	your,
A:	I just,
A:	and rebuke any enemy, because I believe it's a spiritual war that's going on,
A:	and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home,
A:	that's not normal,
A:	there's something going on there, and that I would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that.
A:	Do you see what I mean?
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then the same in Vietnam, you would, you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way, you would handle, uh, Saddam Houssein. *Hussein
A:	But, I was, I have a problem with all the killing,
A:	but I'm not a new ager, I don't believe
A:	I am not for one world government.
A:	I'm not for all these new age things.
A:	I, I, you know, I don't have a problem with, uh, national identity,
A:	and, I'm an American,
A:	and having different nations, and all of this.
A:	But, I'm concerned about the killing that went on there, because I just feel like God has a better way to handle it, than that,
A:	and ...
B:	Okay,
B:	um, so, um, do you have any favorite teams?
A:	Well, I kind of like them all.
A:	I played for about eighteen years, all the way through college, and then, uh, kind of hung them up after college,
A:	but,
B:	Oh, I was going to say, you played pro ball,
B:	right?
A:	No,
A:	not quite.
B:	Not quite, huh.
A:	Made it,
A:	yeah,
A:	made it all the way through four years of college playing ball,
B:	Oh.
B:	Yes,
B:	I'm actually a Met,
B:	I'm, I'm one of these people who's actually a die hard Mets fan, and an avid Yankee hater.
A:	Oh, boy, it, I think it's like one or the other, isn't it. I mean,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's,
B:	I, I, I find it very strange.
B:	Um, more people,
B:	you know, real Met fans don't like the Yankees
B:	and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I never I never quite found a New York fan.
B:	I always found a fan, you know, of either one or the other,
B:	and so, that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox by default, because I went to college also in Boston.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I see,
A:	yeah,
A:	I like the, uh,
A:	huh, I guess if I had to pick a favorite team, any more, as well as,
A:	I kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia.
B:	Oh.
A:	I'm from New Jersey originally.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that, so that's sort of close enough.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, we were thirty miles south of them,
B:	Oh, so you were pretty close.
A:	right down the river,
A:	but, uh, so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry?
B:	Well, I don't know. Um, there's, there's a part of me that says that, you know, um, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away.
B:	You know, when, when he sort of went away, I started thinking, yeah, well, he was performing fairly well,
B:	but he really wasn't worth the baggage, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I think they're okay,
B:	I think they're,
B:	you know, I think they have enough people who are, who are, who are still in their prime, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I mean, certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, you know, um, eight years ago or something, they're they're, they're, they're, you know, they're sort of in, in good standing, whereas, you know, um, I think, I certainly don't think they're the eighty-six team any more.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team
B:	Yeah,
B:	I,
A:	That was, that was the year they beat Houston in extra innings,
A:	right.
B:	Right,
B:	they beat Houston in extra innings,
B:	and then they actually won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route, um, against Boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner .
A:	Yeah.
B:	I felt real bad about that,
B:	but hey, what can you do.
A:	Hey, the guy's making millions,
A:	he ought to be able to perform,
A:	right.
B:	That's right,
B:	well, actually, he, he, he was supposedly, um,
B:	there was, there was something wrong with him at the time,
B:	and I,
A:	Well, his knees were bothering him,
A:	yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and I, and I understand that,
B:	and I say, Hey if the guy can't play, you don't blame that,
B:	uh, hit it to him,
B:	you blame the team, you know, for putting him in,
A:	Yeah,
A:	for having him out there.
B:	That's right,
B:	so.
A:	Sure.
B:	So, I, I, I was, uh, I was also, I was in school at Boston at the time.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	So, I,
B:	it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and, um, half Sox fans.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think we were all pretty much, uh, Astros fans, in the National League Championship Series
B:	Oh.
A:	but there's like two fellows from, uh, Brooklyn,
A:	and they, they were, you know, they were pretty much without having to say, they were pretty much Mets fans
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well I guess they were, uh, I guess they must have been scared after the, uh,
A:	that was more my specialty, I suppose.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And they seem to last longer than pies around here
A:	pies would go practically, in a day's time
B:	Yeah
B:	you,
B:	That's right,
B:	yeah
B:	they are meant for the, that evening's, dessert
A:	Yes.
B:	and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, you know, the leftovers.
A:	Right
B:	Puts about two more inches on his waistline
B:	and then he is chastising,  himself afterward
A:	And ,
A:	Well, it is interesting that,
A:	yesterday, I had lunch with a friend
A:	and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	For, um, uh,
A:	one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town
A:	and, uh, they invited two other couples over
A:	and so there were seven of them that, uh,
A:	I said "well, what did you have"
A:	and she said what she had, uh, just Mexican food,
A:	but, you know, she had, uh, uh, guacamole
A:	and, uh, I cannot remember all she had.
A:	But she also had made, uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.
A:	Have you ever made that or had it?
B:	No,
B:	I have not,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	It's, uh, it's, um,
A:	I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's just a wonderful dessert.
A:	It's like, uh, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And it's, it's quite, actually, not very difficult to make,
A:	but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, she said that she and her husband had, uh, traveled in Spain a couple years ago.
A:	And, and flan is almost, uh, a basic with every meal that you get, there.
B:	Like apple pie in America,
B:	right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	It's just very customary to get flan.
A:	So if you ever run into that you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I would never have thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner,
A:	but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that.
A:	But
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	flan is something you can, make ahead and have just, you know, have ready
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh. Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon,
A:	but I tell you it,
A:	I
A:	my
A:	it's one of those things where it does require some real, uh, planning
A:	and, it's, you know,
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you don't just make the dinner,
A:	you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.
B:	Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, house clean
A:	Yeah.
A:	Probably a good way to do it.
A:	Oh, the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	we are catering a wedding, uh, um, in August
B:	and, uh, this lady that is,
A:	Oh.
B:	it at,
B:	it's at her house,
B:	she is not a good housekeeper.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So she has got to hire this crew, of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready.
A:	Oh.
A:	Good heavens
B:	Yes,
B:	and there, you know,
B:	she is, she must have found some jewels, because they start in the corner and work out.
A:	Uh.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so,
A:	That is such a nice thing,
A:	it's,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, you know,
A:	until,
A:	well we have,
A:	my husband and I have been married twenty six years,
A:	and until last year I had never had another person clean my house,
A:	and, then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then".
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, I had a woman come in, uh, once a month,
A:	and you know, it was not just very often,
A:	but for me it was wonderful
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah
B:	that is nice, you know, to have that,
B:	that's a, luxury, today.
A:	Well,
A:	it is,
A:	and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, I guess.
B:	That's right,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, well, uh, I,
B:	I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique, that has vinegar and egg in it,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have heard about that.
B:	Have you?
A:	but I have never tried it.
A:	No,
A:	well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it,
A:	I do not know that it has egg in it.
B:	Egg and sugar.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have it right on the top of you head?
B:	Uh, I,
B:	no,
B:	I think it would be too hazy, because, um, the,
B:	I, uh,
B:	no.
A:	You do not have it,
A:	yeah.
A:	I would ,
B:	Well, it,
B:	like the liquid is like, a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	and you mix that together
B:	and then you, you know, your,
B:	see it makes, it makes, uh, five pie crusts at once.
A:	Uh, quite large,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, that,
B:	it's quite a volume of,
A:	Right.
B:	I think it's four cups of floor,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, like, uh, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar
B:	and, and you combine your dry ingredients
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you, uh, put in your liquid.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, what is it about the, uh, the vinegar that, uh, makes, the crust better.
B:	It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky,
A:	Uh.
A:	Interesting.
B:	and, you can really treat it rough
B:	and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	boy, that, that's the real secret.
B:	Like, uh, it's not mine,
B:	it was from the, one of the magazines, probably, twenty years ago
B:	and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it
B:	and, it will still be flaky.
B:	I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make.
A:	Oh,
A:	it makes me think of years ago, uh, when I was visiting my mother-in-law in, uh, Michigan,
A:	she lived very near an apple orchard
A:	and we just had,
A:	we could take as many apples as we wanted from it.
A:	you know, according to the owners,
A:	and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead, you know, and freeze them,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be tough.
A:	Those were the toughest apple crust, or apple, uh, pie crust, I have ever, ever made.
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	Wow.
A:	It was terrible.
A:	I, I could have used that recipe,
A:	it sounds like.
B:	Well, I am from Michigan.
A:	Where about?
B:	Detroit,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years, uh,
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	that's real close.
A:	Yeah.
A:	In fact, I, we were there from, uh, seventy three to seventy seven
A:	and, I was, I worked for the little, the weekly newspaper there, the, the Plymouth, oh what was it called, CRIER.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, my husband is from the upper peninsula,
A:	so he was born and, raised up there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That is where my mother-in-law still lives,
A:	so, uh. Are you originally from Michigan
A:	or,
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Born in Detroit.
A:	I will be darn.
A:	Okay.
B:	I think the last one that we actually went to go see,
B:	well, there's two.
B:	I took my kids to see A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS
B:	of course they wanted to see it.
B:	They had the Disney
B:	book and they thought that was wonderful
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they loved the dogs,
A:	It's one of my favorite even,
B:	we went with some friends of ours,
B:	and I was a little worried about my son.
B:	He's about two and a half
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message, you know, that the, the, the puppies are missing
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and it shows the town,
B:	and you can hear all the barking,
A:	A whole lot,
A:	uh-huh
A:	kind of dark,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that kind of bothered him
A:	Good.
B:	but after that he did fine.
A:	Well, how,
A:	is he young?
B:	Yeah,
B:	he'll be three in January.
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay,
A:	that makes sense.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, my kids' very favorite, and yours may be too young for it, was HOME ALONE.
B:	I loved that movie.
A:	They, uh,
A:	well we do, too,
A:	but they just want to rent that one.
A:	That is their very favorite.
A:	They think they're so cute.
B:	Probably gives them ideas of what they want to do,
B:	right
A:	I guess so,
A:	I guess so,
A:	I guess so.
A:	We're not real big movie goers ourselves,
A:	but we did try to go see about a month ago that, um, DEAD AGAIN that black and white one,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I was not real impressed with it.
A:	In fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what, what did that mean,
A:	wait, wait run that back,
A:	and we couldn't run it back
B:	Wasn't that good.
A:	uh-huh.
A:	But we, we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end,
A:	and we thought we were being very quiet,
A:	this man turned around and said, Could you all please save that for later.
A:	And I'm sorry
B:	Oh, no.
A:	We're just not real big movie goers.
B:	Well, I like to watch the movies,
B:	but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's us too
B:	and we rent them
A:	that's us too.
B:	and now we did go see HOME ALONE at the dollar movie
B:	and that was just hilarious,
B:	I died.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I thought that was cute, too.
B:	And we, we did also,
B:	we went to see WHAT ABOUT BOB one night, which is a funny, funny movie
A:	And my husband's name is Bob
A:	and he wants to see that
B:	it's a funny movie.
A:	yeah,
A:	he wanted to see that.
A:	I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE was, uh, that's good for kids, is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking
B:	That's true.
A:	and I thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that.
A:	The little guy is so cute,
A:	and he's terribly rich by now.
B:	I hope he stays cute not spoiled, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	me too
B:	you get to where the money goes to their heads or goes to something, you know,
A:	Oh, that's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	they grow up too fast,
B:	so. But, uh, there's a lot I want to see, you know,
B:	what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out in video.
A:	That's right.
B:	You know, I'd like to see GREEN CARD,
B:	I want to see AWAKENING.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	AWAKENING, is supposed to be wonderful.
B:	Uh, I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
A:	Yeah,
A:	AWAKENING is supposed to be wonderful
B:	Yeah.
A:	my mom saw that
A:	and she said that was an excellent movie.
B:	And see, I've had somebody tell me that REGARDING HENRY, you know, the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good,
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	I'd like to see that.
A:	I think that's supposed to be good,
A:	and I, uh, we have some doctors at church who said that DOCTOR was just wonderful.
B:	I've heard that's good,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
B:	So I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out.
B:	My kids want to see RESCUER'S DOWN UNDER
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I'm going to
B:	my V C R went on the blitz about two weeks ago,
B:	so I'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies, their little, you know, Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff
A:	Oh, dear.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	Well, on, uh,
A:	back to your movie you saw that ten thousand,
A:	uh, HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS
B:	Yeah.
A:	um, did you all ever think about purchasing that one, when it comes out?
B:	You know, I look at those,
B:	like CINDERELLA came out was for sale,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, I don't buy them,
B:	I, now I will copy them and rent them and keep them at home
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar
A:	Well, I understand that, too,
A:	I understand that, too.
A:	Now they had
B:	You know, they don't last that long.
A:	uh-huh,
A:	they had HOME ALONE offered for like,
A:	I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars
B:	Oh, that's pretty good,
A:	and I thought well, now that's, that's close enough to being several, you know,
A:	you could rent it more than more than four times and watch that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That, that makes it worth it, uh,
B:	but, a lot of the Disney movies, it's just too expensive,
B:	and I can rent them
A:	Well, I I understand I understand,
B:	or I can make a copy you know,
B:	my daughter's in love with the LITTLE MERMAID
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	of course.
B:	and I have a copy that's just about worn out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She's four
A:	Yeah.
B:	so she just thinks the
B:	in fact she told me, Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial.
A:	Oh, sweet
B:	Now, I'm not pregnant, mind you,
B:	but this is,
A:	But that's,  in her plans.
B:	she's planning ahead,
B:	Yeah,
A:	Well, it's hard, it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids
B:	Yeah.
A:	and even the ones that we rent at home, the trouble with some of them I know,
A:	we rented ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING thinking that would be so cute,
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	and it's a precious movie,
A:	but the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in,
B:	Now, see, I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie,
B:	but it's been so long since I watched it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't remember the language.
A:	Well, you watch,  it differently when your kids are in the room, you know
B:	Was it bad?
B:	Well, that's true.
A:	and I was just sitting there going, Oh, my goodness,
A:	and I'm going to have to stop and explain,
A:	and they go, I know, Mommy, I know.
B:	Oh, and see my kids weren't in the
B:	you're right,
B:	I watched it without them.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's, it's a little different, because you see things from a different different angle.
B:	Huh.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, we rented,
A:	this summer before we went on vacation,
A:	we rented Chevy Chase and that FAMILY VACATION.
B:	Yes.
A:	And those are just absolutely hilarious
B:	Yes.
A:	but you just really can't watch a lot of that.
A:	We had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it
B:	Yes
B:	Some of it just isn't,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, uh, some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things where I've, where I've, um, learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they were really, uh, helpful, because I didn't know how to do this one stitching,
A:	and so, that was very helpful to me as far as books.
A:	Otherwise, um, I like to read children's books, and things like that.
A:	What about you?
B:	Oh, goodness,
B:	well I was an English major,
B:	so I like to read period.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, lately, I've been, on the whole, very practical,
B:	and, uh, I'm trying, um, to, to, uh, furnish a home
A:	Um.
B:	so I've been looking at, I'm not sure reading is the word, but looking at books on, uh, antiques and paintings and, uh, interior decoration hints and, uh, lots of books on plants and, and, and gardens, because we started a garden and things, things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	So I've been doing very little reading, except I, I did finally dip into a couple of biographies. Um, all of sort of literary figures of this century.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's interesting that you said that.
A:	My husband and I had, uh, took a book out of the library about gardening, too, and started a garden, a fall garden.
B:	Oh.
A:	Um,
B:	Good for you.
B:	I haven't gotten around to that.
A:	Oh, Yeah,
A:	and our, our, uh, cantaloupes and, and, um, peppers and tomatoes are on right now,
A:	so it's been really fun,
A:	and, and we learned that, you know, um, some of the gardening skills we had were before,
A:	but, some of them we learned from a book
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so that was helpful to us.
A:	Now, I've read two books uh, that were, uh, nonfiction lately
B:	Yes.
A:	and, uh, I,
A:	well, one was nonfiction and one was fiction,
A:	and the fiction one, uh, was about a boy in, uh, during the time of Adolf Hitler
B:	Um.
A:	and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp
B:	Um.
A:	and that was not enjoyment
B:	No.
A:	That, that was too realistic and really, um, mind, a real eye opener, uh,
A:	and I guess it's good to read those things, too. Uh,
A:	but, I didn't enjoy it necessarily
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, the other one was quite enjoyable.
A:	It was, uh, about a, a Chinese lady and her generations down, her, what happened to her family through the years
B:	Oh.
A:	so, that one was good.
A:	I think all of,
A:	well, even if they're not enjoyable, they bring you a, uh, some kind of, of learning,
A:	so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that.
A:	So, I, I, I like to read the, the children's books,
A:	I think that's the most animated and imaginative.
A:	So I like those a lot.
B:	Uh, what are your favorite children's books?
A:	Oh, there are a couple of Newberry Award winners.
A:	Uh, A WRINKLE IN TIME is one
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know if you've ever read that
B:	No.
A:	but, but, um, oh, there's one about an Indian girl,
A:	and I can't think of that,
A:	ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS is another
B:	Um.
A:	and that's a good one.
A:	Now, some of the ones that have just received the awards this year, I haven't read,
A:	and I would like to read those
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, it's funny, because I've read some from like nineteen twenty-three and nineteen forty-five and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I didn't enjoy those as much,
A:	and I don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what,
A:	but, uh,
B:	That's interesting,
B:	I, I, I,
B:	well, you can't be an English major unless you like reading things from the past,
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I've read a great deal of old things.
B:	I tend to go, go back,
B:	I don't have any children
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I don't read the new ones,
B:	but I occasionally, if no one's looking dip into something like WINNIE THE POOH, Or, uh, uh, the GRIMM'S FAIRY TALES or something like that um, just because it's sheer magic.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No,
A:	even that's good.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, my children and I, uh, I started a thing where I read a book with them before they went to bed at night.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there was one called THE PIG PRINCESS,
A:	and it was a, a princess from a long, long, time ago,
A:	and she came through a, a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig, um, sty,
A:	and the people that she came to were just farm people
B:	Yes.
A:	and she didn't understand them,
A:	and they didn't understand her,
A:	but it came together in this book,
A:	and it was really a lot of fun.
B:	Yes,
B:	I think that, uh, we, we,
A:	Hi.
B:	Hi.
A:	I'm wondering what, what camping means to you.
B:	When I think of camping I think of, of bugs and sleeping bags and, and tents, uh, like along the Appalachian Trail.
A:	Oh, very good.
A:	That's sort of the same thing that, that I do.
A:	I don't think of, um, trailers and campers and all this stuff.
B:	No.
A:	Um, do you do much camping?
B:	I have never been camping
A:	Oh, you've never been camping.
A:	Oh, gee.
B:	No.
B:	Do you do much?
A:	Well, um, yes and no,
A:	and, the, uh,
A:	I haven't done much recently,
A:	but, um, up until, gee, maybe five or six years ago, I did a lot of it
B:	Really,
A:	and, you know I've,
B:	Where you live now,
A:	Say?
B:	or,
A:	No, um,
A:	I used to live abroad,
A:	and so, I, I camped a lot in, um, the Middle East
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and I was able to camp right in ruins, which was always very exciting and, a bit exotic for those who love bugs,
B:	Oh, I bet.
A:	but, um, and then when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up, um, to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and, and do camping there.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Well, my uh, husband and, and his uncle especially, uh, grew up camping together,
B:	and, uh, they, they just love it,
B:	and they're planning a trip, uh, into Canada this, I guess in about a year,
B:	and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there,
A:	And you're not going?
B:	No,
B:	this is, this is a, a man's trip
A:	Oh, that's too bad,
B:	So they're really looking forward to that
A:	Oh, gee.
B:	so.
A:	I guess it makes a difference.
A:	I grew up camping, being in Girl Scouts and things like that,
A:	so.
B:	And see I was, I was never exposed to it
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so,
B:	I, I feel like I'm a little bit too, uh, much of a city, city mouse to try doing it
A:	Oh, that's too bad.
A:	I think you know, there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like,
A:	but maybe not the, you know the Canada men's trip, but some other, you know,
A:	a nice tent on the, the shore of a lake,
A:	and,
B:	What's the best part about it to, to you, the, the quiet, the getting away?
A:	Right,
A:	the, the, the no telephone, the,
A:	gee whiz, you go to bed when it gets dark,
A:	and you get up when it gets light
B:	Wow.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, um, I guess just, just the change, from the rat race.
B:	Now, do you usually, like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around,
B:	or is it pretty much isolated.
A:	No,
A:	it's, uh, it's pretty isolated, um,
A:	and to me, I like that, I guess, too, although there are people,
A:	I mean, you know, it's really hard to get away
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I guess when, when we did sites in, in the Middle East, of course it was with a group, in order to make it safe
B:	Yes.
A:	but, I mean, we'd go in different parts of the ruins, and, and things like that.
A:	But we didn't even have tents there,
A:	we just sort of put out the sleeping roll
B:	Oh, good grief.
B:	That, that does sound neat,
B:	but I don't think I, I've got quite enough nerve to do that.
B:	I know my husband's gone, uh, for several days on the Appalachian Trail before,
B:	and he said that you can, a lot of times you can go for, you know, a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail.
A:	Right.
B:	So it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think.
A:	Right.
A:	Actually I just joined, um, the Appalachian Trail Walking Club, or whatever they call it,
A:	what,
B:	Oh.
A:	I love to walk
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I'm going to start with day trips, though, because I don't know the territory and all,
A:	and I'm not sure,
A:	my son is not eager to go
B:	I think it would be,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well, that sounds really neat.
A:	Oh, but, you know, I'm going to try
A:	Well, gee whiz,
A:	I hope you get into camping some day, just slowly.
B:	we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, uh, I,
B:	maybe, like you said, start out slow and, and kind of get used to it, and find out that it, maybe it's not as bad as I, I fear it might be
A:	Right,
A:	I think that, you know,
A:	I guess one time recently we went up to Maine, and had planned to camp,
A:	and you know, the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field,
A:	and I said, Gee whiz, for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a, a motel which we did,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, so that, you know,
A:	if the setting was right and that, it's, it's great,
A:	but if it's,
A:	Well, I've been real, um, thinking I'd love to buy a new car, right now, if I could afford it.
B:	Oh
A:	But we have two cars right now
A:	and we're still paying on them,
A:	but I would love to have one of these new mini vans.
A:	I've got two little ones
A:	and I think that would be just the perfect family car
B:	I,
B:	right now my car is terminally ill
A:	Oh
B:	so I am really looking at, uh, facing the purchase of a car.
B:	And,
B:	uh, what I would like to have is so totally impractical for me that, I won't do it.
B:	But
A:	What is it?
B:	Uh, well, I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, you know, I don't even like the wind blowing in on me
B:	so I don't know why I think I want one
B:	but I do.
B:	Uh, I will probably stay with a foreign make.
B:	I've had real good luck with them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We have, um, we have,
A:	we went out to buy an American car
A:	so we bought, um, a Chevy Nova about three years ago.
A:	And, and we opened up the, the hood
A:	and it said Toyota, made in Japan, right across the front of all the engine parts
B:	Is that right?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Toyota, uh,
A:	well, the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry.
A:	Uh, at that time was the same car
A:	so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to.
B:	Oh,
A:	I thought that was pretty
B:	well, I didn't realize it.
B:	I knew that one of the, that Nissan which is Toyota had, uh, joined with, had a plant over here.
B:	but I, I never thought of,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I know, uh,
B:	you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	That's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written, I mean, imprinted on the engine.
A:	It was real interesting.
B:	Huh.
A:	But, uh, I,
A:	with so many options now available, you know, where, where cars are concerned, it just seems like there is, there's almost too much of a choice anymore.
A:	You know, there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever.
A:	I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car, I would take into consideration the price naturally.
A:	But, um, you know, I would really want something that I would want for that much money. For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	and that's minimum.
A:	Oh,
A:	definitely
B:	It, you know it's, it's a major purchase, now.
B:	What we used to pay for homes is now what a car, can cost.
A:	I cannot imagine that, you know, somebody,
A:	I heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about, oh, it would, how, exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase,
A:	and I thought, I don't think I'd find that exciting
A:	I'd be wondering, you know, here I am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money
B:	If they held their value, that would be one thing.
A:	That's true.
B:	But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot, they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, you know, that,
B:	I don't know that, I'll go with,
B:	I've bought a new car the last three that I've bought
B:	and I don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we had a pretty,
A:	we bought our Chevrolet brand new
A:	and then we bought a used car
A:	to Just a minute,
A:	I'll change your diaper.
A:	Then we bought our, our next car used
A:	and, uh, we had better luck with our used car,
A:	and I like it more.
A:	It cost us less money
A:	and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money.
B:	Well, I'm, I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car.
A:	If you can find one that's uh, you know, reliable
A:	If you can get someone that you trust to buy one from
A:	or, you know, make sure that you can have it checked out well enough
A:	Uh, I wouldn't
B:	and they don't drive them that much.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sh ,
B:	Six thousand is just getting broken in for them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if I can find one or a repossession.
A:	That's,
A:	we bought one like that.
B:	And with the banks being in such financial, you know, problems now that people,
B:	you can find the banks willing to sell you a car.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	We bought one car that way
A:	and had,
A:	we bought it real reasonably
A:	and it was in real nice condition so, because apparently whatever the bank get ...
A:	Okay, Diane.
A:	And a very good afternoon to you.
B:	And good afternoon to you.
A:	Do you, uh, do most of your cooking at home
A:	or do you, uh, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?
B:	Um, no.
B:	I do most of my cooking at home
B:	and, um, I could safely say that I have never cooked for a dinner party.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	My goodness
A:	Well, what would you, uh, like to cook?
A:	What's, what, what's, what is your favorite, uh, recipes, uh, that you would like to have for a dinner party?
B:	Um,
A:	Now you're in Dallas, is it?
B:	Right,
B:	I'm in Dallas.
A:	Okay.
B:	Of course, um, dinner parties down here probably, oh, turn out to be more things like barbecues
B:	And,
A:	I was, I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost, Tex-Mex.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, Tex-Mex, uh,
B:	Mexican food, um probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's a very interesting food though
A:	and when I go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods I like to find.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	We have, uh,
A:	I think Chico's
A:	or, or in these different restaurants in this area that, uh, have all this fine Mexican foods.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, if I were to cook, uh, a dinner party, uh, it may be standard to you
A:	but, uh, actually I never get too much fried chicken.
B:	Fried chicken.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I love twice cooked potatoes.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	I have.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, I like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and, and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	As you can see, I'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal
B:	Right
A:	And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, how would you improve upon that?
B:	Oh, improve upon that?
B:	Let's see.
B:	I'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in.
B:	And some,
A:	More fresh vegetables?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Included to that?
B:	Uh, green beans and, uh carrots and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	How do you cook your green beans?
B:	My green beans?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes.
A:	So you
B:	And I like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them.
A:	All right that's what I was wondering about.
A:	What, what you use and, and in herbs and so forth.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, I like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it makes them pretty tasty.
A:	Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans?
B:	The Chinese type.
B:	Are they the real,
A:	We use soy sauce,
B:	No,
B:	I haven't ever used that.
A:	Well, you might, uh, be interested in that.
A:	Have,
A:	it gives a very delicious taste.
A:	You, you have a soy sauce taste
A:	and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the, uh, water and,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, golly. What's this white powder that, that, uh, that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce?
B:	A white powder.
A:	I can't even think of the name of that right at the moment.
B:	Um, gosh.
A:	Anyhow
A:	sorry about my mind.
B:	That's okay.
A:	But, uh, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it.
A:	If it does
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it, it brings out such a, so much different things in, uh in the string beans.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I like it to try them differently.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you might, uh, think about that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I might try that.
A:	Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	I love Chinese.
A:	And, uh, north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous.
B:	North African?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's, uh, made from, uh, I think they call it, beans.
A:	And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous, uh, absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish.
A:	You probably have to buy that from specialty stores.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	C o u s, c o u s.
A:	And that's a, a north African dish.
A:	They eat it one to two meals everyday in north Africa.
B:	Huh.
A:	And it is very very flexible.
A:	You can do a lot of things with it.
A:	It makes a fantastic, uh, uh, salad with cucumbers and, olive oil and onions
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, boy,
A:	real tasty.
A:	Well, I've enjoyed talking with you,
A:	and I hope I've given you some ideas
B:	Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
A:	and, uh, that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	Well, thank you very much Miss Diane.
B:	Okay,
B:	thank you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right, Carolyn,
A:	When do you,
A:	are you reading the papers about the, the Middle East summit?
B:	Uh, some.
A:	Yes.
A:	I'm just a little bit too.
A:	I think, um, I think I was worn worn out from Middle East after the war.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think it kind of, uh, it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did I think during the war.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's I think, uh,
A:	I don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's really, uh, really important.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I think they just have a whole different world than we do
A:	so, I don't know.
A:	But I don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be?
B:	Oh, well, you know, I just see this Middle East situation with, with Russia and everything there that's happened I think that that crisis has kind of slowed down,
B:	and I see the Middle East as being, you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to negotiate, trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, um,
A:	I don't know I have, uh, I just have this, this civil rights mentality I, I guess.
A:	You know should we
A:	or, or you know, should we, uh,
A:	those, I wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess that's what I, I hope for them.
A:	But some of them don't want those freedoms I think.
A:	Their, their religious beliefs may, um, may not, you know,
A:	they may not want it as a whole
A:	so I think that's something that has to be considered too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I think that's a, that's really a long term type thing.
A:	I know that the, the,
A:	it said think about long term repercussions
A:	and I was just thinking, well, peace is peace you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that really is the nicest thing.
B:	I guess the question in my mind somewhat
B:	and, and it depends on the country, you know,
B:	I think some are more peaceful than others.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	If you look at, um, Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the U N going in there and the, the bomb development and all this kind of stuff, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Gosh.
B:	I think, you know, we should have got him while we could or whatever.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think so.
A:	I think, um,
B:	And I think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East, you know, the, the constant fighting, you know
A:	And,
B:	and,
A:	Right.
A:	I think, I think they realized we would probably never push him out
A:	and, uh, I think the other,
A:	probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think they, they look at force as a way of you know, their, their means to their ends.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yep.
B:	And, uh, so I, you know, I don't know so much if these peace talks are going to,
B:	I don't know how much they'll stay to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, if, if we, even if we say that we're going to do stuff, I don't know how they'll stick to that
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think the, the thing is though I, I guess the, the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that, that coincide with the, the U S ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I guess that's all gone.
A:	I think that's really, uh, probably what started the whole process.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I,
B:	Well, that's probably a bonus on our part.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
A:	I think, I think that they're they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the Soviet Union
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I guess they're saying, well, you know, we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways.
A:	We can either act like we're going to be pro-communist or act like we're going to be pro, uh, pro-democracy
A:	and whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do,
A:	but we really won't change in the long run.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's the way I sort of see them all working, you know.
B:	I tend to agree with you.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I think they have in mind what they want to do
B:	and I think a lot of times their might make right .
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know it,
B:	kind of the forceful, you know,
B:	I don't know.
B:	But I just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis.
A:	I always find it very hard in my heart to to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But then again they have to live in that environment.
A:	They have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings, and terrorist attacks and whatever.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Then they have to negotiate almost everything
A:	and then you think to yourself, well, you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else,
A:	but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in, then you have to sort of
A:	like, I don't know,
A:	logically,
A:	Golfer?
B:	Well, yes,
B:	I am as a matter of fact.
A:	Well,
B:	Not a good one,
B:	but I am a golfer.
A:	Well, that's about the way I am.
A:	I don't consider myself a good one,
A:	but I do enjoy it.
B:	I, uh, haven't been out all year.
B:	I didn't get out this year,
B:	but, uh, I enjoy both watching it and playing it.
A:	I usually play a couple of times a month.
A:	Sometimes more,
A:	but lately it's been just about that.
A:	But, I do enjoy,
A:	I think the, one of the things I enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses.
B:	Yes,
B:	and, the, the peacefulness.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You can get out there,
B:	And the little critters that are around.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's really neat.
A:	You can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there.
B:	That's right
B:	and it's such a personal challenge.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	it really is.
B:	More than competitiveness against someone else.
B:	It's, it's a competitiveness against yourself.
A:	And, you know, it's so frustrating,
A:	I keep wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating.
A:	You think you do pretty good one day
A:	and you're doing a whole lot better, you know,
A:	and then all of a sudden you go back out
A:	and it's just terrible.
B:	Well, you'll,
A:	You can't do anything, right
B:	Or you'll hear thirty and think, boy I got my game together.
B:	I've had a par and a birdie, and a bogey
B:	and then you quadruple bogey
A:	And you think, my goodness, why did I think I was doing better
B:	Being down there, do you, uh, get to see, like the colonial or any of those?
A:	I don't,
A:	I guess I could.
A:	I've never been to a golf, to a major golf tournament.
B:	Oh.
A:	I, uh, watch them on T V a lot.
B:	You really should go at least once.
B:	You know, we've had, uh, the P G A up here.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and in Tulsa
B:	and I've been to both of them
B:	and it's it is so much fun to see these players you see on T V to, and to hear that ball go whizzing by.
A:	Really?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, it's, it's like a bullet going by.
A:	I'll bet, um.
B:	And, you know, to, to see their concentration and yet to see them, how friendly they are when they're, walk by you, you know, and how good they are to their spectators.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I've only been playing like about three years now.
A:	My husband's played for twenty-five.
A:	But, I just took it up about three years ago
A:	and, uh, we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments.
A:	We belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas,
B:	Both,
B:	Yes.
A:	and, you know, it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
A:	You can meet some really neat people.
B:	The scrambles are fun.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	they really are.
A:	I just love them.
B:	I belong to the country club there in El Reno when I lived there
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You really, on those, you really go out for fun.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, you know, you won't,
B:	you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four, you know, that's going to make any difference.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right.
A:	And you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it
B:	That's right.
B:	I used to, when I worked at Kerr McGee, I used to play in their tournaments.
A:	Really?
B:	And, uh, now that was very competitive.
A:	Really?
B:	And, I enjoyed it tremendously,
B:	but, uh, I, I'm more, I think I get more enjoyment just couple friends going out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And if, if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green, so be it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be better
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have never played in any tournament except just a scramble.
A:	They have a lot of them there at the club, you know,
A:	they have A B C D type tournaments
A:	and then they, they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well,
A:	but, I don't know,
A:	I've just never really gotten into that.
A:	Now, my husband and all the men, I mean, they love the real competitiveness of playing for money, you know.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	every hole.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I, I'm not good enough for that
B:	Does your club have a good woman's association?
A:	Yes,
A:	they do.
A:	I don't do much with it since, uh, most of theirs,
A:	they have a traveling league,
A:	and, uh, most of their meetings and all are during the week
A:	and I don't, don't get to play except on the weekend.
A:	I work during the week all the time.
B:	It's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Someday when I, I get where I live closer to the club and partially retired, maybe I'll, uh, be able to play a little more
A:	but,
B:	It, uh, it's, it's a, it's a good game.
B:	I, uh, I wish I had more time to play
B:	and I felt, you know, had more energy to play it, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
A:	My children are all grown up.
B:	Oh.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, now see, I've got two children
B:	and, uh, they're,
B:	one is uh, just turned to be a teenager
B:	and the other one is on his way,
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, uh, I'm a single parent,
B:	so I think it makes it more difficult for me to, uh, you know, find time with my, my children since I work
A:	I'll bet.
B:	and then, of course, take care of the house and all this good kind of stuff.
B:	Uh, so it's a real, uh, it's a real problem for me.
A:	I'll bet it is.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What is the favorite thing you do with your children?
B:	Uh, the, the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, the kids like to play Nintendo,
B:	but I'm no good at it,
B:	so I don't like to play.
A:	You just watch them play, huh?
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	I, I tried it once or twice,
A:	but I didn't feel like I was very good at it either.
B:	Me either.
A:	My grandson got me to one day,
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they talk about these different levels and stuff
B:	and I've never got off of level one
A:	Different worlds
B:	Yes.
A:	and how do you get to another world, you know?
A:	And I, I don't even know what they're talking about.
B:	I, I know,
B:	I agree with you,
B:	the other thing I think we like to go to the movies, too.
A:	Do you?
B:	That's,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's a, that's a neat thing.
B:	So I guess we're all in, uh, you know, movie, uh, fanatics or whatever around here.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So we like to do those kind of things.
A:	I know when our kids were growing up, our, we were big into water sports.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We had a boat
A:	and they all skied
A:	and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing
A:	and they always took other friends with them
A:	and we had a lot of fun doing that,
A:	but I had all girls
B:	Oh, how neat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so we didn't do too much sports wise.
B:	Oh.
A:	I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and little boys do all of those things
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	but,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see, I have a son
B:	and, uh, you know, it's football in the fall and, and baseball in the spring
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I'm constantly going back and forth.
A:	I'll bet you really are.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And my daughter has, uh, tennis,
B:	so it's between tennis and, and bowling.
B:	My,
B:	I bowl
B:	so, you know, we're pretty active as a sports, you know in, in the family,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, when mine were real little, they all played soccer you know, that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they got more interested in other things,
B:	Boys
A:	I'm not sure that they would admit it at that age, that it was boys,
A:	but I think that's probably what it was.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I, I know that, uh, my daughter, uh, even though she goes out with the, the sports and everything, uh, yeah she likes to watch the football for, uh, the kids
B:	I'm sorry.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that was a cat that hit the telephone.
B:	Get away, cat,
B:	gosh to
B:	I guess it's why they wanted to do it on this type of telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on.
B:	But, uh, yeah,
B:	my, uh, my kids are, they're starting to grow up, you know.
B:	It's not going to be too many more years before I, uh, uh, you know, they'll be gone
B:	and, and, uh, there won't be as many activities.
B:	Do you, uh,
A:	But they,
A:	but you enjoy them,
A:	I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree with you.
B:	I, I do.
B:	I'm so glad they're out of the, that young, real young age
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the babies,
A:	And, I mean, I didn't,
A:	it wasn't that I didn't like them when they were little,
B:	Right.
A:	but the older they got, I enjoyed them as teenagers.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	And now that they're each,
A:	of course three girls, they're each becoming the, they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How,
A:	what kind of mothers they are,
A:	what kind of wives, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's so true.
A:	How they do things
A:	and,
B:	Well, do you, do the, do your daughters live close where you can go out?
A:	Two of them live real close to me.
B:	Oh, good.
A:	So we, we spend a lot,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and we play with the kids, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where oh,
A:	we go camp out,
A:	they camp out
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we spend weekends at the, in the country with them quite a bit,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but as far as doing any activity, now that the grand kids are here, we all just stay around the house mostly.
B:	That's true.
A:	It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	oh, yes.
B:	Boy, I know, especially when they grow up like that,
B:	so I'm trying to, these last five or six years, I'm trying to make them really special and uh, very precious since that's, uh, about the only time we've got left.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They'll always remember it, too.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
B:	absolutely.
B:	I, I think so, too.
A:	I hear mine saying, well, I remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so.
A:	I need to take my boys to do this or that, you know.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	There we go.
B:	I know, I know they can't wait
A:	Yeah,
A:	they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	But,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so well, I still got a few more years,
B:	so I'm, uh, I'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as I can with them.
A:	Do you work?
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	I sure do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I work full time,
B:	so, uh, it, it,
B:	that cuts into our free time right there.
A:	It really does.
A:	The time you have with them has to be quality time then.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right
B:	and, uh, vacations are very special for us, and activities.
A:	I imagine that they have, uh, some, a lot of homework, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You know, this being a school night and stuff,
B:	so, uh, it's, it's in the same old you know, routine of, uh, you know, doing homework and, you know, trying to talk between all of that and, and, uh, the other activities that we all have.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, there's just so many things to do with them nowadays, though,
A:	and especially if they're active kids.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like you say you bowl.
B:	Do you know
B:	I don't know what to think.
B:	I, I, uh,
B:	the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort.
B:	I want to believe that, that they really are trying to change. That, that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society
B:	and I, I want to believe it's all okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But then there's that side of me that says, yeah,
A:	Right.
B:	so, so it's like there is a struggle within me going do, do I be open-minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality.
B:	You know I, I trust people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'll do that.
B:	Or do I keep on going, well, we'll wait and see
A:	Well, I think there's a, a struggle within the Soviet Union.
A:	Um, I think the people are, are just fed up,
A:	and I think it's showing
A:	and all the republic is trying to gain their independence,
A:	and I think, uh, that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, hey, maybe this Communist thing isn't working.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's it's not just a or, uh, western society telling you it's, it doesn't work.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, they've always said, you know, the, the Soviet people were united,
B:	we believe this,
B:	and maybe they are seeing that, no, no, hey, we don't believe this, you know.
A:	That's right.
A:	I think,
B:	I guess I keep that one part of me that's like,
B:	well, I don't know I want to trust them
B:	and I,
B:	it's like I can't,
B:	and maybe it's because, you know, we've had our own propaganda over the years,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, that, that could be.
A:	You know what I,
A:	we always, we think of the K G B and we think such bad things, you know.
A:	But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, you know.
B:	And they probably do the same things.
A:	exactly.
A:	They do.
B:	You think the C I A doesn't spy?
B:	I'm sure they do.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	they do, you know.
B:	Now the difference is we don't, I, I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe.
B:	You know, I think to that extent we don't go as far
B:	but I'm sure they lie. You know?
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, absolutely.
B:	So,
A:	That's part of that propaganda thing,
A:	and I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, oh,
A:	excuse me, I've got a cold today.
B:	That's all right.
B:	I hope you get better
A:	Thank you.
A:	Um, I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are seeing, seeing it, you know, thinking K G B and C I A and all that
A:	but, uh just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they are, they ain't going to be able to feed their people this, this winter, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	And I'm not against them being concerned
B:	but I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and, and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, I mean, you know, any, any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, you know, because I, I understand that, you know, you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government.
A:	Right.
B:	But at the same time I, I agree.
B:	I don't think we can do it and, and just, you know, turn our backs or, or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here.
A:	That's right.
A:	You know, we've got, uh, we've got quite a few domestic problems that, uh, that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.
A:	I think the problem is, you know,
A:	on the international scope maybe the president feels that, uh, you know, for long-term relations with all these countries it's important
A:	and well, we'll, we'll always have the United States.
A:	And, you know, we need to solve these international problems
A:	but, um, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, uh, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we, we believe in what he's doing abroad
B:	but, but like you said there's issues here too.
A:	Right.
B:	And but I, I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.
B:	I'm encouraged by what's happened in, you know, the, the iron curtain countries, you know, in, in that block
A:	Right.
B:	and, and I think it's moved in the right direction.
B:	I, I think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight.
A:	Yep.
B:	You know, it's not going to.
A:	No.
B:	It didn't happen here overnight,
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	And I, I think sometimes we forget that.
B:	But I, I, I, I have to say, yes, I'm, you know, I'm encouraged by the way it's going. Uh,
B:	uh,
B:	Okay, Lowell,
B:	so I'd like to know, um, what, what do you do in lawn and garden,
B:	what, uh, what's, what's of interest to you
B:	and how do you go about it?
A:	Well, I have a town home,
A:	so I don't do a lot of regular maintenance,
A:	but I do have a large garden out in back,
A:	so we do a lot of things with perennials and, uh, also a few annual plants, uh,
A:	and then every year I grow a garden.
B:	Oh, you do, you do actually, uh, grow a garden to produce food?
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So how much room do you have?
A:	Um, we have virtually no room out in front,
A:	and then in the back I'd say we have about an eighth of an acre
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we pretty much fill it up with, uh, like I said, perennials, things that aren't, don't have to fool with every year,
A:	but then I've got, uh, a twenty-five by twenty area that I do gardening, as far as, you know, tomatoes and cucumbers and beans
A:	and.
B:	Oh, that's what I was curious about,
B:	I was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and, and then put down your garden and then put them back in later, or something like that.
B:	So you.
A:	No,
A:	we have a separate area for the garden.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	you do have a separate area.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and last year was the first year we tried two new things.
A:	We tried corn,
A:	and we tried a watermelon.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, tell me this, uh, Lowell,
B:	do you do you enjoy doing that kind of work,
B:	and do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it?
A:	Uh.
A:	I enjoy doing it on a limited basis.
A:	I don't think that if I,
A:	the reason I bought a townhouse is so that I wouldn't,
A:	I get,
A:	I'm allergic to grass.
A:	So I don't mow grass or anything like that.
A:	So I think if I had a big home and a big lawn I'd, I don't believe I would enjoy it.
A:	But just on the limited basis that I do it, I do enjoy it very much.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I'm a little more fortunate I think from that point of view.
B:	I'm not allergic to things,
B:	and I moved here in State College quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land.
B:	So, actually I have nine acres
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	And, uh, for many years I grew sweet corn,
B:	uh, and, and my kids were there,
B:	and so we set up a shop there,
B:	and, uh, I would, uh, collect the corn very carefully, ear by ear,
B:	and it was never more than one to two hours old,
B:	and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn, because they knew it was individually picked and very, very fresh.
A:	How about that.
B:	So we had a nice thing going there,
B:	and it was delicious.
B:	Huh, I really enjoyed that,
B:	and then I also have a, a garden.
B:	Oh, it's probably, uh, twenty-five by thirty or forty, something like that, that I put in my normal food garden things each year,
B:	and, uh, I have a little bit of everything, or a whole lot of everything in the
B:	actually. I love, uh, broccoli, brussels sprouts,
B:	and I have all kinds of tomatoes, kale, and all those good things,
B:	and I rent out my field that I used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer,
B:	and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use,
B:	so I get out of that amount of work at any rate.
A:	Well, that's nice.
B:	It is, it is very, very nice.
B:	I, I really enjoy it.
B:	My problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as I would like.
B:	I enjoy it very much.
A:	That much land requires an awful lot of time.
B:	Yes,
B:	it does.
B:	Uh, and actually I had a pony there for twenty-five years,
B:	and he had two acres that he had for his own grazing
A:	How about that.
B:	So he had his own backyard garden, too.
B:	But that, that worked out very nicely too.
B:	I built him a barn back there where, in the part of my corn field,
B:	and he lived in that,
B:	but, uh, as far as gardening is concerned, we do enjoy it.
B:	My wife is in charge of the flowers.
B:	She does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property,
B:	and we have, you know, an acre, an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of,
B:	and she has flower gardens and bulbs, perennials and things.
B:	We have blueberries, blackberries.
B:	I have two or three, uh, apple trees,
B:	the Golden Delicious were fantastic this year.
B:	My neighbor has pear trees, and, um, oh, blueberries, all kinds of food around there, if we just had time to take advantage of it.
B:	My wife has spent probably I don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning pears, because there were so many of them,
B:	and I have been totally engulfed with Golden Delicious apples.
B:	I just couldn't handle the, the amount of them we got this year.
B:	It's really been a remarkable year.
A:	Well, I bet you could answer a question for me.
A:	What's a good apple to bake pies with?
B:	I use my Golden Delicious,
B:	and they make delicious pies.
A:	Are there 'n
A:	there's an
A:	Okay, um,
A:	do you participate in family reunions?
B:	I did for years.
B:	I don't have enough family left to have them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But.
A:	Did you, uh,
A:	were they far away,
A:	were they close?
B:	Well, I come from a family that was very large in Bell County
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon and had ten children,
A:	Oh, how neat.
B:	and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then, sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group, you know.
A:	Oh, that would be fun.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was a lot of fun.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, we, uh, we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's, uh, oh,
A:	it started probably about forty years ago, uh, because I remember going as a teenager before I was ever married,
A:	and then my husband and I went, uh, while we were still dating,
A:	and it's still going on,
A:	and it used to be held at Lake Brownwood, down at Brownwood, Texas,
A:	but now we hold it at, uh, Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we have had as many on a Saturday night,
A:	it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday,
A:	and we've had as many on a, uh, Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty.
B:	Um, now we would have group like that in Arkansas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred.
A:	Yes,
A:	and we took, uh,
A:	our family all brought in food and everything.
B:	Well, so many of us came from a long way that we, we'd usually at a motel
B:	and we bought food there.
A:	Oh, uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, I know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in
A:	and we go get Kentucky Fried Chicken and bring out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, but we kind of take our food for three days,
A:	and, uh, now our grandchildren are participating in it
A:	and just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	enthused and with it
A:	and our children, you know, thoroughly enjoy it.
B:	Right.
A:	So it's been kind of nice.
A:	It started out when I was a youngster and watching my mother.
A:	Now I'm to the mother was
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I am, uh, now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter you know, more and everything,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh.
B:	Well, it's something I really miss, because I had twenty-seven first cousins
A:	Oh, my word.
B:	and, you know, we were very close family,
B:	but our father's generation was enough older than I,
B:	my father would be a hundred now that they're all dead,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, in fact, many of my first cousins are dead
A:	Oh, are they?
B:	and of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that,
B:	so we really, very rarely all of us get together
A:	Get together any more.
B:	and, and we're a long way away,
B:	and, and the younger generation, the next like my cousin's children, I don't know very well, you know.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But it,
B:	so it's,
B:	I doubt that that will come to be again,
B:	but as long as my oldest aunt lived we, we got together once a year.
A:	I think, I do think, now we have noticed a waning of interest,
A:	and I think as, as parents get older and start dying off, I think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going.
B:	Well, and, and folks have gotten so mobile,
B:	I mean, like I have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but my brother and his wife live in Nevada, my daughter lives in Colorado, one of my nephews lives in New York City, one nephew lives in Memphis and my son lives here,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you probably do good just to get your immediate family together.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, I'm divorced,
B:	and really only immediate family I have left is my, my,
B:	I have a son and a daughter.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But my family's really all dead.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it was great pleasure while we did it, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	they're a lot of fun.
A:	Well, my
A:	I have a sister,
A:	and then we have a son and a daughter
A:	and we have three grandchildren
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and our son and daughter are both married
A:	and, uh, our son's not as interested in it as our daughter,
A:	but our daughter, our daughter is really interested.
A:	And, uh.
B:	Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it?
A:	I beg you pardon?
B:	Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it?
A:	Oh, a little bit.
A:	I, I wish that our son was you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, but, uh, the cousins are closer to our daughter's age, and, than to our son's and just totally different, interest group,
A:	and plus,
A:	and he's just, he's newly married and doesn't have children
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, I'm hoping, that as they, you know, are, married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go, you know, to it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know that.
B:	Well, what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested?
B:	Just talk to them about it?
A:	Well, talk to them about it, and, you know, tell them some of the things we're doing.
A:	Now when he was a uh, a young, oh, preteen, you know, when he was like ten or twelve he loved going,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	he had another cousin he was close to and went,
A:	but that cousin kind of quit going,
A:	and as he got to be a teenager, uh, he wasn't quite as, as interested.
A:	He was more interested in rock and roll,
A:	and this is more country western group
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, just lack of interest,
A:	All right.
A:	I, I like keep forgetting to make these calls.
A:	I've been on this list for two months.
B:	Oh, really,
B:	I just, Oh, I just got mine last week,
A:	I think I've made four calls
B:	and I haven't started yet because I wanted to get one first see how it worked.
A:	Right.
A:	Well there are some kind of nice prizes,
A:	and it's worth doing it.
A:	I so mad I think I've had this for two months
A:	and, like I've said, I've made four calls,
A:	and lot of times we don't answer the phone, probably when I get mine early in the evening
B:	Really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we're supposed to talk about movies.
A:	Have you been to any lately?
B:	I have, I was trying to think of the one I went to a couple of weeks ago,
B:	but I forgot it already.
A:	Uh, I haven't really seen one since probably August because, uh, every weekend in, in the Fall we go to our high school football game on Friday then we go out with friends after,
B:	Oh.
A:	and that's kind of the our social for the,
B:	That's your weekend.
B:	Yeah
B:	really.
A:	But, oh, I saw, uh, ROBIN HOOD, which I didn't care for.
B:	Really.
B:	I didn't see that, because I didn't think I would care for it.
A:	No,
A:	and my husband dragged me to it.
B:	Oh.
A:	I like, I think Kevin Costner's a nice fellow,
A:	and he's nice looking,
A:	but he just, to me, is not a very dynamic actor.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's why a lot of people go to see him, though
A:	I guess because he is good looking.
A:	I don't know
B:	Right
A:	I don't know
A:	Oh.
A:	I saw CITY SLICKERS.
A:	Did you see,
A:	that was a,
B:	Yes
B:	I did see that
A:	That's the last one I saw, I think.
B:	and I really enjoyed that.
A:	I did too.
A:	I thought that was so cute,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I thought that was appropriate just for everyone.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It was great.
A:	Oh, I, I really enjoyed that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and my daughter went to see that one too.
B:	So, it was fine for her
A:	Right.
B:	so, yeah.
A:	Which most of them probably aren't
B:	Right,
B:	well that's right.
A:	I don't know what my kids see any more.
A:	My kids are twenty and sixteen,
A:	so they've probably seen about everything at this point
B:	Probably they have.
B:	Well, my daughter is twelve
A:	Oh.
B:	and we had a sleep over one night.
B:	They wanted to watch PRETTY WOMAN, which I have
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I was hesitant,
B:	and they all had seen it anyway.
A:	Oh, I know it.
B:	all twelve,
B:	so.
A:	That's the way it is.
B:	Yes,
B:	they do
B:	yes,
B:	they do.
A:	there's no way to protect them any more.
B:	Right,
A:	So.
B:	but I didn't think they were great for my daughter
A:	No,
A:	it'll teach a great lesson, because she ended up so, in so
B:	No.
B:	Really,
B:	really.
A:	But it was a fun movie to watch.
B:	Oh, I love PRETTY WOMAN,
B:	and then I like that one after that where, oh,
B:	what was it?
B:	It was like a FATAL ATTRACTION thing.
A:	Oh, the scary one?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, I didn't see that,
A:	but the,
B:	I don't remember the name of it
B:	but that was so good.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	That was really excellent.
A:	Oh, I like scary ones that are realistic.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that was, that was.
A:	They say is really frightening, too.
B:	What was?
A:	, the new one that came out.
B:	Oh, I don't know.
A:	They say it's really horrifyingly scary
B:	Really.
A:	but, uh, I'd never get my husband to that.
A:	He doesn't like to be scared
B:	Oh.
B:	The last scary thing I saw was MISERY.
A:	Oh, and my kids both saw that.
A:	They liked it.
B:	That scared me to death,
B:	and I watched it at a friend's house on video
B:	and I was just.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	Gosh.
B:	It was horrible.
B:	It was so awful.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	that one sounded gross,
A:	I know my husband wouldn't have stood for that.
B:	Really.
A:	He, he likes MARY POPPINS and things
B:	I like that, too.
A:	Yeah
B:	I like funny movies
B:	and I like scary movies.
A:	I do too,
A:	I, I really like a variety.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where are you from?
B:	I'm from New York.
A:	Oh, I was going to
A:	well my husband's from New Jersey,
A:	and we lived there for five years when we first got married
B:	Is he really.
B:	Oh.
A:	and so, it sound kind of nice,
A:	it was familiar your accent.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yes,
B:	it's so close,
B:	I'm from Long Island
A:	Oh.
B:	so that's close, you know,
B:	that's more related to New Jersey than it is to like Rochester, New York, those, that kind of thing.
A:	Right.
A:	I don't know up there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	different,
B:	it's it's different,
A:	Just, uh,
A:	different,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah,
B:	I guess.
A:	Well, see the accents up there fascinated me, because even in his family alone, there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently.
B:	Oh.
B:	Really.
A:	And, and his family, they lived in the same house there,
A:	most of them were twenty or so you know.
B:	Really,
B:	and they were all from New Jersey.
A:	Yeah
B:	Um.
A:	uh-huh,
A:	and they lived, you know,
A:	they never moved into apartments when they were young,
A:	they always stayed at home until they got married,
A:	it seemed to be the custom up there.
A:	Or they went in the service,
A:	and so they were together for all that time
B:	Really.
A:	But they still,
A:	their accents differed a little in the family
B:	Um.
A:	so, and it.
B:	When did you live there?
A:	Uh, in the sixties.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I finally.
B:	I was in New York in the sixties.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I converted him to being a Texan.
A:	I, I just thought life would be,
A:	I knew it was easier back here.
B:	Are you from Texas?
A:	Well, sort of.
A:	I'm an Air Force brat,
A:	but I was real familiar with Texas.
B:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I went to college here and everything.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And I just thought, you know, we could probably get a better house,
A:	and life is a little slower, a little easier.
B:	It is, it is,
B:	yeah.
A:	He loves it.
A:	He, he really, would never want to leave,
A:	so it worked out.
B:	I'm used to it now.
B:	So, I like.
A:	Not hard when you first came.
B:	Um?
A:	Was it hard when you first came?
B:	Oh, yes
B:	it was. Because we're here eighteen years
A:	Oh, my.
B:	and you can imagine what Plano was like eighteen years ago.
A:	Oh, I know,
B:	It was very difficult.
A:	Oh, compared to New York, oh,
A:	yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was very, very difficult.
B:	I didn't even want to talk.
A:	Were you all transferred?
B:	Yeah
A:	Um.
B:	yeah.
A:	I have a friend down the street's from New Jersey
A:	and they were,
A:	he got a,
A:	What kind of books do you like best?
B:	Well, I alternate between Danielle Steele is one of my very favorites
B:	and, uh, then I try to go into one of the self improvement books.
B:	Uh, we, we take books every once in a while in our Sunday school class and go through them.
B:	Uh, I love Scott Peck and his ROAD LESS TRAVELED.
A:	Huh, yeah,
A:	I've heard of that one.
A:	I don't think I've read it.
B:	Oh, it is it is wonderful.
B:	I, I thoroughly enjoyed that.
B:	What do you read?
A:	Well, uh, I'm a Tom Clancy fan.
B:	Okay.
A:	And I read,
A:	I just finished a book on Novelle Netware, uh,
A:	that's computer stuff.
A:	I do a lot of computer reading
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	and, uh, I'm just finishing another one up on, uh, statistical sampling,
A:	so, I do more work kind of related reading than, uh, just for enjoyment.
B:	I, I try to keep a book going all the time.
B:	Uh, I try to read when I first wake up in the morning and then before I go to sleep.
B:	So I probably get, oh, thirty to fifty pages a day read.
A:	Well, that's pretty good.
B:	And I just, you know,
B:	I don't feel like,
B:	in fact this morning, I was almost late for work because I'm almost at the end of this book
B:	and I didn't want to put it down
A:	Oh, I've had them like that before, too.
B:	But I like, I like mysteries.
A:	Mysteries.
A:	Any particular writer?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	I like, uh, uh, oh,
B:	I'm drawing a blank.
B:	Uh, he wrote the, uh, BOURNE ULTIMATUM.
A:	Ludwig,
B:	Ludwig, yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, uh, I like Jeffrey Archer.
B:	He is an English author who writes some mystery.
B:	Uh, well, I guess they're, they're a type of mystery.
B:	They're usually some
B:	he's a ex-lawyer
B:	so, or, he, he's a lawyer who no longer practices,
B:	but his are all, have some part of the law, uh, enveloped in them.
A:	So, you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself.
B:	Right,
B:	and then, uh, the new author that came out with, uh, oh, the one that, uh, Harrison Ford starred in.
A:	RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stuff.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	it was the, uh,
A:	Oh.
B:	it's late,
B:	I'm tired,
B:	so I'm not thinking too well.
A:	What, what time is it there, ten thirty?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it's nine thirty here.
B:	Oh, it's, uh, it was his first book.
B:	It came, it was on the top of the list, uh,
B:	he was a D A.
A:	Uh, PRESUMED INNOCENT?
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, I haven't seen the movie, uh, or read the book
B:	Okay,
B:	and then he's, he came out with the second one.
B:	Uh, a sequel to it.
B:	And both of those I've enjoyed real well.
B:	But I, I like that.
B:	I love Danielle Steele
B:	and, and, you know, if I want to get a fantasy and get away from it all.
A:	Is she is she kind of racy?
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	she isn't at all.
A:	Just feel good.
B:	Her books, uh,
B:	you always cry.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	I mean, it's, it's always good for good tears.
B:	Uh, one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is FINE THINGS,
A:	my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers.
B:	it's, it's always going to make you have a good cry
B:	and you know it's going it turn out good
B:	and you're going to be happy in the end
A:	Oh, well, that's nice.
B:	And I said, you know,
B:	I don't want anything too real anymore.
B:	I have enough of that in my own life.
B:	I want, I want happy, fantasy
B:	like.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, you mentioned Sunday school Ladonna.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, do you,
A:	are you a BIBLE fan, too?
B:	Uh, I, I do my share of it.
B:	I, I certainly can't say that I understand a lot of it.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	but, uh, that's always a challenge.
A:	So do you do,
A:	my wife talks with other people,
A:	Okay Jerry.
A:	I guess, uh, tonight's topic is about, uh, personal computers and level of interest and, uh, and your, your expertise.
B:	Oops
B:	Oh, well.
A:	Oh, well.
B:	Well, okay,
B:	well, let's, let's fire away.
B:	Uh, well, Brian,
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, first of all,
A:	you want me to start off?
B:	Yeah,
B:	why don't you, why don't we, why don't you do about thirty seconds
B:	and I'll do thirty seconds
B:	and then we can work off of there.
A:	Okay,
A:	real, real fine.
A:	Uh, first of all, uh, yes,
A:	uh, I do own a P C here at home
A:	and I also have one at the office.
A:	And my level of interest is quite high with P C
A:	and I was really, I am really interested in them, however, not to the extent as I was about, uh, two years ago when I basically knew about everything there was to know about different things
A:	and that was the time when we were shopping for one.
A:	And I think we got a top of the line at that time,
A:	but, uh, as you know P C change quite rapidly
A:	and the technological advances kind of outdated our P C where I can get the same P C I got two years ago at the fraction of the cost.
A:	And I also enjoy using ours at home
A:	and we use it for a, a number of different things.
A:	Plus I get in a lot, an awful lot of good use of one at work, where I work.
A:	Lot of, uh, analytical, uh, testing, reviews, uh, lot of different things I use it at at work,
A:	so I enjoy P C
A:	and they, they make my life and my work a lot easier.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	he picks them up and rolls them across the patio.
A:	Oh really.
A:	They were not hard are they?
B:	No.
A:	Are they a hard worm?
B:	No.
B:	They're not real hard,
A:	They're not a hard .
B:	They're like a, water bug, of sorts,
A:	Huh.
B:	I don't know what, they're called.
A:	Oh, are they black then?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they roll up.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I can't think of what kind they would be.
B:	When you touch them, they roll up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm no help on that, then. Because, I can't think of what they are. What they would be.
B:	But, I'm plagued with those.
A:	I think you have a lot more insects down there even than, than what we have.
B:	You know, I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone.
B:	You know, we don't really, we only freeze down here in January, and February, at the most.
A:	I know, my brother had trouble with fire ants, and that even.
B:	You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I got fire, ants too.
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	And they be can be a real dickens.
B:	And, you, spray in one part of your lawn,
B:	and they just move to, another part.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So you got to, spray your whole yard,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and your, your, your neighbor gets them,
B:	and then he sprays his yard,
B:	and you get them back again
A:	Yeah
A:	you keep trading them
B:	Yeah.
B:	But we're not doing too bad down here really, you know,
B:	the daffodils are out
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Ours are going to be coming out.
A:	Now our cancer society sales daffodils.
A:	Right now, they're, they're big now.
A:	So, we, we have daffodils, here in the house because of the cut flowers,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they're just beginning to come out and bud.
B:	Yeah.
B:	See mine are up and bloomed already
B:	so,
A:	Uh,
B:	already.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They sure are, pretty,
A:	uh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I like them ,
A:	uh, they're such a nice bright early Spring, color.
B:	yeah.
B:	And then in, in my back flower bed I have, uh, tiger lilies
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they bloom in, you know, late June, mid, July.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they're, beautiful too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they are.
B:	They real, beautiful.
A:	They're beautiful.
B:	They're, they're nice and green, you know,
B:	they're, uh, they're up above a foot, maybe eighteen inches.
A:	Oh my.
B:	They come up real pretty, every year, no problem.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We won't have too much here for another couple of months yet.
B:	Is it still pretty cool up there?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We're it's raining today.
B:	Well, do you all have a,
B:	what kind o grass do you grow up there?
B:	Do you grow, uh, Bermuda or ,
A:	Well, our grass, like I said is just grass.
A:	We really didn't plant anything.
A:	It's just,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh,
B:	See we, I have Bermuda, in my yard,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I still have the old standby crabgrass here and there,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, Bermuda seems to be,
A:	It's probably, very pretty.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Bermuda seems to be pretty, good down here.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We have some people that have done their lawns,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay
A:	They suggested that we, uh, discuss what we think of when we say camping.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What do you, where do you like to camp?
B:	How do you like to camp?
A:	Oh, I can camp just about, most anyway
A:	Camping or, uh, motor home is nice, uh, travel trailer, pop up,
B:	I used to, uh, live in the Ozarks and, uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	Oh.
A:	You really rough it then.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you do that very often?
B:	I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I used to do it quite a bit.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	Yeah.
B:	it was real hilly.
A:	That would be really great.
B:	Take a twenty-two
B:	and go out.
A:	Pardon?
B:	Take a twenty-two
B:	and find a creek.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That sounds like it'd be fun.
A:	Did you go alone or with a group or,
B:	I used to go with my brother.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We just lived up there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that's great. Long as it's not raining.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it gets kind of,
B:	I, we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Really,
A:	oh, that would be,
B:	But I don't know much about camping in Texas.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Well, I'm in Pennsylvania.
B:	You live in Pennsylvania?
A:	Yes
B:	I didn't know they did this.
A:	Are you in Texas, now?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm down here at T I.
A:	Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas,
A:	but, uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of Pennsylvania.
B:	I used to be in Ohio,
B:	it's some pretty country up there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well you kind of know what it's like, then.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	But, we've, uh, we've done, uh, many types of camping.
A:	We've, we've done tent camping,
A:	and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, if you don't want to rough it too much.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You can get the, they have some nice camping grounds you know, that have the water piped out
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	just set it up
B:	and get out of, get out of the city for awhile.
A:	Right.
A:	Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on.
A:	We, when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, Delaware along the ocean most every year.
A:	And that was fun
A:	we stayed mostly in state parks
A:	and, uh, we really enjoyed that.
B:	Tell you what,
B:	I'm losing you.
A:	Huh?
B:	I said I'm losing you,
B:	you're getting you're fading out.
A:	Oh, maybe my, dropping my phone.
A:	Is that better?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
A:	But,
B:	So what,
B:	you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we used to,
A:	we don't as much anymore,
A:	but, uh, we used to.
A:	We kind of slowed down a little bit.
A:	But, uh, I think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining.
A:	If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.
A:	I don't think I would like that.
A:	What kind?
B:	Uh, copperheads mostly,
A:	Oh.
A:	Those aren't too pleasant.
B:	No,
B:	they're.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We have some of them around here.
A:	You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.
B:	Yeah.
B:	One year they were, they were just everywhere.
A:	Oh.
B:	I don't know what it was,
B:	we had a real rainy spring
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then it was all year,
B:	there was just copperheads everywhere.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But you still backpacked and camped out.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well I lived down in, down in the bottom of a big hollow
B:	and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If it rained we were stuck back in there.
B:	Had a four wheel drive.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You just get used to it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I would think, I would think a cave would be, could have problems like that, too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	This cave that we used to go in was little,
B:	it was small
B:	it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	is your brother younger than you
A:	or,
B:	Yeah.
B:	He's about a year and a half younger.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	well, that's great,
A:	that'd be a lot of fun.
A:	You have a lot good experiences from that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was.
B:	Saw a few bears things like that.
A:	Did you really?
A:	What, black ones?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That would be exciting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary
B:	but, uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.
B:	But, uh,
A:	They're on the increase in this area.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know if,
B:	they don't have them up there do they?
A:	The black bear.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, do they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	the population's been really up.
A:	They've, uh, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, uh, increasing so much.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they, down here they, they stopped for awhile
B:	or they really made it hard to hunt them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know what it's like now,
B:	I haven't been back up there in awhile.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, we, we really like camping.
A:	I, I must say that, uh, we we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping
A:	and, uh.
B:	Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	It's just, so, it's a lot of work, too
B:	Yeah.
A:	it's, uh, you know, getting ready and taking care of everything.
A:	But it's, um, it's really refreshing.
A:	So,
B:	Well, I think we're about to run out of our time.
A:	I think so
A:	Well, it was really good hearing from you
A:	and I hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm sure, I will.
A:	Okay.
A:	Thanks a lot,
A:	and you have a good day.
B:	You, too.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
B:	All righty.
B:	So, uh, do you think Russia's still a threat?
A:	Well, I guess I'm maybe naive,
A:	but I never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us.
B:	There you go
A:	I mean, obviously there's the, the, the possibility of, or, was the possibility of war, uh,
A:	but, I somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable,
A:	but, uh, I don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that, that I think this question was meant.
A:	What about you?
B:	Well, I think,
B:	have you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR?
A:	Yes.
B:	Okay,
B:	you know, like, how, uh, these two, there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S during the whole time
A:	Right.
B:	and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as, as themselves, you know,
B:	the prisoners of wars were, were the same as the people living in that country.
A:	Right.
B:	And you didn't want that to happen.
B:	And to me, it had always been that way.
B:	I mean what happens is, you have a government, right,
B:	and this government controls everything, right
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then you have the people inhabiting the country
B:	and these people have nothing to do with the government itself.
A:	Right.
B:	And these people are the same as you are.
A:	Right.
B:	And what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country, supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country, it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself.
B:	Like I was telling people, I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on.
B:	In in Lithuania, they, they were announced to be a separate country.
B:	But, yet, the, the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people
B:	and the U. S. didn't go in there and try to save those people.
A:	Right.
B:	You know. It's like you're not going to go in there and say no,
B:	listen,
B:	there's a separate country.
B:	Why,
B:	because you're going into the border.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Once you get into the border, then there's a threat.
B:	But what happens is you don't mess with us, we won't mess with you,
B:	but let's mess with the neutral countries.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, and now it's like you know, they're saying other people were, were I guess, other leaders were still crazier about it, you know,
B:	like other people, you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there,
B:	but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And the U S has.
B:	You know, it's like they, it seems like they can, their, their army or whatever can, can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do, do the job with, uh, you know, less suffering.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, but I think, I think the thing is, is that there, the thing
B:	like they were saying they go, you know,
B:	like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button. But not the U S S R,
A:	Right.
B:	The U S S R wouldn't do it. Because they got too much at stake.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I guess there was concern, uh, that Iraq would use, you know, nonconventional warheads with, with the chemical weapons and things
A:	but yet it didn't happen.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean why not.
B:	Well, My, my point of view to that is, is that it would have had so much, I mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had.
B:	I mean the first, you can imagine the first, uh, chemical weapon used
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, you know, three hours of when the weapon was shot.
A:	Oh, so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it.
B:	Right.
A:	But, yet the,
B:	And what happens is, what happens is,
B:	suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will,
B:	he's got one less thing to go against him.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I mean, if he were to use that, he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But the U. S. also makes a lot of, uh, you know, treaties with other people like saying, okay,
B:	if you give up, then you can come live in our country
B:	and we'll take care of you, like Marcos, right.
A:	Right.
B:	We'll overthrow you,
B:	but yet you can still come live here, you know.
A:	Right,
A:	I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.
B:	Uh no.
B:	No.
A:	I think that's, that's, that's not very likely.
A:	But yet you know, as, as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I guess that makes sense what you said that, uh, within their own borders they feel freer to do what, what they feel necessary.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, you know, there's, there's just, you know,
B:	like people will go, like they, like the U. S. goes and goes into Panama
B:	and what,
B:	see I don't believe in war.
B:	That's my thing.
B:	I don't believe that anybody should die you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so then, you know, you have,
B:	because what happens is,
B:	suppose I'm, I go to war
B:	and I'm holding a gun
B:	and I'm just looking at myself holding a gun
B:	and whoever shoots first survives, you know.
B:	But that same person also has a family
B:	and, you know his parents are going to cry
A:	Right.
B:	and, you know, life ends there
B:	and to me that's ridiculous.
B:	You know, I mean, I just don't believe it.
B:	I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't,
B:	but it's pretty hard to think that, you know, people are just going to shoot each other down
B:	and it's legal in a situation like that.
A:	Well or that, that it resolves anything in the end. That that negotiations couldn't resolve.
B:	You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, I mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous
B:	and he, all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so and keep his power,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	but, well,
A:	Well, it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S.
B:	No,
B:	I, I don't think so.
B:	I think, uh, they're getting, they're especially getting their life back together now
B:	because a lot of things that you saw on TV,
B:	a lot of, uh, inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to.
A:	Right.
B:	A lot of like dancers and stuff like that.
A:	Right.
B:	They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete.
B:	So it must be a beautiful country.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's just that, you know, they won't let you get out
B:	and when you want to get out of the country, that's what you want to do.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So, oh, well,
B:	I got to go to class now.
A:	Okay,
A:	well thanks.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Hello.
A:	Hello,
A:	this is Jim in Dallas.
A:	Uh, how you doing?
B:	Fine.
B:	I'm Callie in Garland.
A:	Oh, you're right here,
A:	okay
B:	Yes.
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm actually working tonight,
A:	I just, uh, called and came in.
B:	Oh are you.
A:	Do you work at T I?
B:	Yeah,
B:	you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I just got a little booklet, uh, this not what we're supposed to talk about, just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts,
A:	and I thought, I better make some calls.
B:	I know,
B:	I know,
B:	they.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I haven't had a chance, I haven't got a chance to look at them yet.
B:	It was a lot nicer than I expected.
A:	My daughter, uh, got a few calls at home.
A:	She talked to some student in,
A:	I guess they give them to computer students, too, in, uh, Virginia, something like that.
A:	She's talked to two students.
B:	I've talked to,
B:	I don't think they were students,
B:	one, I think, worked at a university, university um, and the furthest away I've talked to someone has been New York.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	great.
A:	Uh, we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, I guess, uh,
B:	Yes,
B:	we are.
A:	Do you have anybody that you, uh, are close to that decision on, or anything,
A:	or, I've thought about it for myself and all,
A:	and my my wife's mother is in a retirement home.
A:	She's not in a nursing home. Uh.
B:	Oh, well that's a,
B:	did you push the button?
A:	Yeah,
A:	did I, didn't we push?
B:	Did we,
A:	Let me, I'll hit it again just in case.
B:	Okay,
B:	just in case
A:	I did it as she said,
A:	yes.
A:	But, uh, she's she's down in San Antonio
B:	Now, what,
B:	Oh.
A:	and it's, it's a, uh, it's a brand new one.
A:	It's a Catholic, uh, retirement home for nuns.
A:	It's at, uh Trinity, uh,
B:	Oh.
A:	no,
A:	let me see, Trinity,
A:	I keep calling it
A:	it's not Trinity,
A:	I'll think of,
A:	Incarnate Word,
A:	and they have a retirement home for the nuns
B:	Well, isn't that neat.
A:	and they take some lay people.
B:	Isn't that neat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and that one's really super.
A:	Now I, I know what they're talking about on regular retirement.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's not too many,
A:	they do have a wing where the people who are really sick, you know have nurses.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that's good.
A:	And then they have other wings that we visited, uh, that are very nice.
A:	I mean it's just super.
B:	That's neat.
B:	Just supervised more or less than anything and security, I guess.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	they, they, they have, uh, like, uh, a guard with locks.
A:	We've been there once at night at Christmas.
A:	She just went in last year.
B:	Oh.
A:	She drives and everything,
A:	she, she, she's perfectly healthy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	What made you all decide to put her, or what made her decide to go?
A:	Well, her husband died.
A:	They were in the military together,
A:	and she just did not want to take care of the house
B:	Right
A:	and she visited the place, and then fell in love with it, and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind, so to speak,
A:	and so she's happy as, as heck,
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	and they serve meals, of course.
B:	That's great.
A:	They have clubs and a swimming pool,
A:	so that's nice.
A:	Now I, I know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they were all more or less hospitalized type you know, really, really sick.
B:	Right.
B:	Shut-ins and,
A:	It's a tough question.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really is.
B:	I worked in one as a teenager.
B:	I volunteered,
A:	Oh, you got more experience than I do then on it.
B:	Well, it was really, it was really sad, heartbreaking, I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, I just, oh, I just felt for those people, especially the ones that never got visited.
A:	Oh, that would be awful.
B:	That just bothered me.
A:	I never thought about that, you know.
B:	That just bothered me so much, especially, you know, at my age,
B:	I was probably about fourteen.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that really made a bad impression on me
B:	I always thought, not really bad of them, I mean, because they are, most of them I believe are probably pretty good for the people,
B:	but, I don't know.
B:	It's just a, it would be a tough, tough decision.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that, uh, hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it,
A:	and they're getting nicer.
B:	Right.
A:	I've seen on T V where they take animals and young children,
A:	in fact my daughter is one.
A:	My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,
A:	and boy that really pumps them up.
B:	Helps,
B:	yeah.
A:	That is very nice to see young people.
A:	I think that's one of the sad things, is when you're in an older home.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	If you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything, you know
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	you can't take care of them,
A:	kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home,
B:	Right.
A:	but it's nice to have them visit and everything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and get that youth back.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, um, just stationary
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, they'll get in a wheelchair
B:	or they'll just sit in a chair
B:	and, and, until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just stationary,
B:	and I feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long.
B:	So I do, love to see young kids go and, and men take the pets and everything.
B:	I think that's a real, real neat idea.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think you do get more by by stimulation.
A:	My, in fact, my mother in law just visited.
A:	She's just about seventy-five. Again, perfectly fine.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, one, and, and she visited us here in, in Dallas.
A:	When she went back, every time she goes back to, uh, San Antonio, my wife has two sisters there, too, she said she's much better,
A:	she's much more alive and, and, uh, active when she's been on a visit with somebody else, you know
B:	That's,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything
B:	Right.
A:	and she's much,
A:	and so the stimulation part is really important. I think, like any animal, anything
B:	Right.
A:	you just lay around, uh, that's the fastest way to die, I think, you know.
B:	Stagnant
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's exactly right.
B:	I think they're really neat.
B:	Um, of course I've seen those reports on T V, the horrible ones
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and that scares me.
A:	I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper.
A:	Anything bad, I like, I like to, flip, I flip it off.
A:	But it's sad,
A:	it's sad,
A:	yeah.
B:	It's sad to think that we would do that to people,
B:	and you know, I've seen them on T V with, uh, bed sores,
B:	and oh, they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And I just think, how can you do that?
B:	These people have given so much of their lives, you know, to, to America you know, whatever,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and here is how we treat them.
B:	Just put them in a home and leave them.
A:	Right.
A:	When I was, uh, younger, we, I lived in the East,
A:	I'm from the East really,
A:	and it seemed like there were several people that I knew that had their, uh, parents, I guess they would be, but well in their
A:	living with them.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And one of them was even a woman who was fairly old,
A:	and I guess she, she had her own separate room.
A:	And I think, whether it's more a custom up there, or maybe because I was younger
B:	Right.
A:	and it's just not a custom anymore to have, uh, you know, the grandparents live with you anymore.
A:	I guess that, uh well, we aren't getting away from that, which is not right.
B:	I think,
B:	Right.
B:	I think it's neat.
B:	I think, uh, you learn a lot from them from all their experiences,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories.
A:	Oh, right,
A:	right.
B:	I think that's neat,
B:	because they really have a lot of good insights that my my husband's father is really old.
A:	Yeah.
B:	He, he had him late in life,
B:	and he's, he'll be eighty this year.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I just, uh, he lives with different, you know, people in the family.
B:	He'll switch from time to time.
B:	I just,
A:	Well, that's nice in a lot of ways.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just couldn't imagine locking,
B:	not locking him up, but putting him in a home and just,
A:	Bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
B:	Lock him up.
A:	That's what I think about it for me,
A:	I think, Well, my kids better not do that to me.
B:	I know,
B:	I know.
A:	I don't want that, you know.
A:	So I, I think of it, Well, how would I want to be treated rather than, well,
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	it's easy to say, Oh, yeah,
A:	let's put these old folks in a home,
A:	but when I think I don't want to do that, you know.
A:	I don't want to be
B:	That's right.
A:	I'd want to have my little home.
A:	I always threaten my daughters,
A:	I say, Well, I'm going to build a little house behind yours,
A:	and I'll take care of your lawn, he says,
A:	but I'm not going to one of those places.
B:	Oh, you're going to put me away.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	That's what my mother,
B:	she always,
B:	You're going to lock me up one day, aren't you.
B:	I can tell,
B:	you're going to lock me up.
A:	That's what we, that's the way we call it, which is really wrong.
B:	I know.
A:	But my wife's mother, and the one, she's in San
A:	it's everything but.
A:	The opposite of what you've seen.
A:	I mean it's a little hotel, you might say.
B:	Right.
B:	That's great.
A:	Again, a swimming pool, and grounds,
A:	and she has enough room.
A:	She has two bedrooms, and a, and a separate living area.
B:	Gosh.
A:	They don't have kitchens or anything
B:	Right.
A:	but they have little, it's like uh, on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal, you know.
B:	Yes.
B:	Prepare your,
B:	Well, that's great.
B:	Now can she leave, um, on a day by herself?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it's, it's, it's nothing like that.
A:	It's like living in the hotel.
A:	I mean she's totally on her own.
B:	Oh, man.
B:	That's neat.
A:	Uh, and she still drives, which we do, does scare us some, because she has dented a few things, you know,
A:	and we keep thinking about that, you know
B:	Right.
A:	because she, they get less alert,
A:	and they don't care,
A:	and I've seen some of these elderly people on T V you know, the ones from Florida that just run into people
A:	and they don't even understand what happened, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	I know,
B:	bless their hearts,
B:	you hate to hurt them by doing that,
B:	that's like their one last thing that they can still do,
A:	I know.
B:	and you take away that driving ability
B:	and that would really be hard.
B:	We've, Well, we've thought about doing that for my husband's father, because he,
A:	I, I know.
A:	Go ahead,
A:	I'm sorry.
A:	Oh, he still drives?
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's well, it's wonderful in one respect,
A:	but I don't know if you can afford the insurance,
A:	yeah.
B:	Well, luckily he drives a big old tank
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, he, I mean, I don't think he, he could get hurt.
B:	I just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone.
B:	But he he hasn't had any accidents luckily.
A:	Right.
A:	That's good.
A:	I mean, people are all different.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I, I wonder if they should give them a test, or at least maybe not take their maybe give them a refresher driving course, and just to see how well they are every five years.
B:	I saw that on TWENTY TWENTY.
A:	Are they doing it?
B:	They, um, you know, they're testing that, they're, you know, thinking of doing that.
B:	And I think that would be a great idea, because I think they do, come, become less aware,
B:	and they just, I don't know, they, and they don't hear as well, for one thing
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that doesn't help.
A:	Well, everybody needs retraining.
A:	It doesn't hurt, uh, you know,
A:	the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches,
A:	and I don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving.
B:	Right.
A:	It would sure, the insurance companies would, would probably help pay for some of that, you know.
B:	At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away
A:	Right,
A:	there you go,
A:	there's a good point
B:	It's on the state
A:	very good point.
A:	Very good point.
A:	But I think they maybe, should do that,
A:	and then the families,
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you, have you noticed any new, uh, trends in politics?
B:	Well, the one I think is interesting is the California, Los Angeles police chief who says he won't resign.
B:	And did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that, uh, he should?
A:	Oh, really?
A:	No,
A:	I didn't hear that.
B:	I think it's, I think what's interesting is that, uh, the political activists, Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating.
B:	I find it interesting that, uh, outsiders would bother to go in.
B:	How do, how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved?
A:	Uh, I think sometimes it's good for people outside.
A:	They get a different uh, perspective on an issue and stuff.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	I don't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved.
B:	Well, do you but do you think Gates should resign?
A:	I think, though, that it should still be, uh, sort of up to the majority in the area.
A:	I don't know,
A:	on something like that, they wouldn't really vote on it or anything, though.
A:	Uh, probably so, just because they were under his authority
A:	and he obviously failed somewhere along the line.
B:	Well, well, speaking of that kind of issue, have you kept up with John Wiley Price?
A:	Yeah.
B:	What do you think of him?
A:	Oh, um, I think he's got good intentions,
A:	but I'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right.
B:	He's an interesting person.
B:	I was talking to someone who said that, uh, for all his obvious attention to, efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the, uh,
B:	I guess he's on the County, uh, oh, Board of Supervisors or
A:	Right.
B:	and, the, the, the, uh, at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that this stuff we see in the, you know, in the media is, uh,
B:	well, he's really just trying to make a political statement.
B:	I, I find that an interesting element of politics that we don't, that, that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a, is a, you know,
B:	of course, he's got in this, this deal of racism and the, you know, name calling and all this.
B:	But apparently, he's a, a worker.
B:	Uh, you may disagree with him,
B:	but I, I, I find this whole,
B:	what do you think of this, uh, fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas?
A:	Oh, I think that they should go ahead and go to the, uh, fourteen one.
A:	I, to me it's just fair, you know,
A:	an equal, it seems like every area should have an equal voice.
B:	I agree with you
B:	but did you see the map they drew up on, uh, on how they were going to divide up the districts?
A:	No.
B:	It was, it was the strangest,
B:	I'm, I'm not sure it was gerrymandered,
B:	but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff, I, I, I guess I'm a little cynical of the, of the power base.
B:	I, I, I, and I don't quite understand why the power base, uh, doesn't, uh, why they don't go with fourteen one.
B:	I, you know, and, you know, the, it seems to me that what happened in the, in the election, that a lot of the people, they said particularly the, the, uh, I think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect,
B:	and it's,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that, uh, the fourteen one, it,
B:	I don't know.
B:	You can, you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and, uh,
B:	what's, what's the lady's name?
A:	Diane Ragsdale?
B:	Yeah.
B:	You can disagree with, uh, what they're doing and what they're saying,
B:	but in reality I think they're, they're trying to represent their constituents.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think Dallas is doing itself a disservice.
B:	I think they ought to get on with something important.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they really make themselves look bad,
A:	and I don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I, but I think even, I, even those people are,
B:	it's like Pauken and Box and these people,
B:	I think it's, it's kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done.
B:	It's like this whole school issue.
B:	Are you involved in the schools at all public schools? This whole thing down there where they're, they're trying to, um, uh, you know, devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
B:	and, and it all seems, you know, like everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else
B:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I,
B:	I, I have got to run to a meeting.
A:	Okay.
B:	It was good talking to you.
B:	I don't think we've gone our, our ten minutes
B:	but I think we've, we've talked long enough.
A:	Okay.
A:	Good talking to you.
B:	Okay.
B:	Good night.
A:	Bye.
A:	Well, there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by, uh, Kitty Kelly, the unauthorized biography.
A:	Are you interested in that at all?
B:	Not really
B:	I'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan,
B:	so I, I don't particularly read, um, biographies or autobiographies.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	I haven't read too many.
B:	I, I'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that, not of that nature though.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I, the reason why I was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to,
A:	I'm not a fan of Nancy Reagan
A:	and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it.
A:	And I thought just purely for entertainment, I might enjoy that.
A:	But I, I wouldn't want to go out and buy it like, you know, the hard back copy of it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I might check,
B:	If they, if they had it, I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though.
A:	Really.
B:	I, I just, you know, I'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, unless maybe they lived a long, long time ago.
B:	For me it would be interesting to find out what life was, uh, like, you know, in that period.
B:	But, Not, not really interested
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	In biographies.
A:	Well, I, uh,  I have read some biographies.
A:	I prefer to read,
A:	if I read a biography, it's mostly because maybe I have to, uh, you know,
A:	back when I was in school I had to have information about that person or, um, preparing some kind of lesson
A:	and I need to have more information about people.
A:	But I, I do like to read some biographies,
A:	but that one just sounded like gossipy.
A:	And I wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover, but flip through just for, just to get a good laugh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think the last biography that I read, I'm not, I think it was, it was, um, on Lady Randolph Churchill, Churchill's mother.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that was excellent.
A:	Was it?
B:	Um, yeah.
B:	It was,
B:	it's in two parts.
B:	I think the first one is called JENNY or something like that, uh, because that was her name.
B:	And, um, I only got to read one part of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've been looking for, you know, the other half of it and read the,
B:	I read that half where she was in her later years,
B:	and it was absolutely excellent.
B:	And it was very descriptive of, of people with money back then and, uh, affluents in England, uh, that, you know, were associated to the king and all.
B:	And it was,  really pretty fascinating.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I and that was actually a couple of years ago,
B:	so,  it's, it's been a while since I've read,  any biographies.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	A while.
B:	Uh, I love to read.
B:	I mean, I'm constantly reading.
B:	I read, I like, uh, mysteries,
B:	and I like, um,
B:	as far as improving myself, uh, I haven't read any lately.
B:	But I was reading classical works that I hadn't read before.  You know, that you might have needed to read in school, but that I just didn't read for some reason or another, another, or that, you know, that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of.
A:	Uh-hum.
A:	Right.
B:	And you have so many out there that, uh, that you, you know, you never get a chance to read.
B:	And so, I said,
B:	well, I think it was because I read, um, Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just, um, that, even when I read it now, it still makes me cry, the ending of it.
B:	And I couldn't believe, I, I could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'd read some Dickens before,
B:	but I hadn't read that one.
B:	And I, I was like, I thought to myself, you know, what other things are out there that are, that are classics,  you know, that have withstood time and that are just excellent,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written, you know, that was written about.
B:	And, um, so I started reading.
B:	I had this like, you know, I had a binge of
B:	my mother, uh,
B:	I was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband,
B:	but my, uh, mother sent me, you know, like you know, uh, boxes full of different books.
A:	Oh!
B:	And, uh, she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over.
B:	But she, she is constantly, was, I guess because,
B:	it seems like, uh, older people have much better, uh,
B:	in their schooling, they, they got more of the classics than I did,  you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she knows so much more of them than I do,
B:	I wouldn't even know, you know, to go look for that author or that book.
A:	Right.
B:	You know.
A:	Well, I like the classics too.
A:	Uh, I think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books.
A:	And I, well, I don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at, uh, well, like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out, paperback type books.
A:	Usually, I, I'm going to the book store for a particular reason, uh.
B:	probably you read a book review or something.
A:	Yes.
B:	A review on it.
A:	Yes,
A:	and, and, uh, I buy some of the, not self-improvement books, but, uh, self-help books
A:	like, we just bought a new house,
A:	so I bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for, you know.  And, or how to repair this or repair that in your own home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I bought that for my husband
A:	And, or how to, how to do something books, you know, for reference.
A:	And, uh, and those are really helpful I think in helping, um,
A:	well, you know, like some, symptoms, medical symptoms, like when, how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not,  type books, which I use as reference and have been real handy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But purely just for enjoyment,
A:	I, I had a major in English and linguistics,
A:	and so I have a lot of books in my home that I can read from the classics,
A:	and I do enjoy those quite a bit.
A:	And, um, so I tend to, for reading just day to day, uh, you in sound know, I have a particular book I'm looking for
A:	or I just enjoy, uh, you know, the newspaper magazine.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's handy.
B:	Well, what I do is I usually have two books at one time.
B:	I have a classic which I have to work on, basically,  you know, uh, just depending,
B:	well, some authors I can just, you know, basically drink in,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but others, eh , I really do have to work at them.
B:	And then, um, whether, you know, they're a foreign author or whatever, um, or if it's their style or, or just understanding the material.
B:	And then I, you know, some of those, it's like I said,
B:	it's like school,
B:	you have to work at it.
A:	Right.
B:	But to me it's worthwhile in the end.
B:	I feel good about it,
B:	and I usually remember those a long time later.
B:	And then I have books that I read just purely for enjoyment,  you know.
A:	Light reading.
B:	I mean, yeah,
B:	just light reading that are,
B:	I particularly like Dick Francis books, and just some of the, the authors that are, uh, for mysteries, just, you know, just, uh, purely for entertainment,  you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's it,
B:	I'm not really expecting to get anything out of it,  except to be momentarily pleased, you know, because I don't, I can never remember,  the plots or anything,  later on those books.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things.
A:	It's not like, uh, most television where you, you know, you just, you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but,  still understand what was going on.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, television, it gives you everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's basically mindless.
B:	I mean, all your, the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you, you know,  what you're hearing and your, your uh, your sight.
A:	Right.
B:	But they give you everything else.
A:	Right.
B:	And it's usually, the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's, it's, it doesn't even have some of the underlying, uh, things to it, you know, that maybe the old movies and things had, you know, the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or, you know, like with Hitchcock or something where you're, you're, you're either expecting something or
B:	I, I don't know,
B:	it just, I don't really care much for T V at all.
B:	I just,
B:	I mean I sometimes get hooked into it,
B:	but I really, I really get mad at myself when I do, because I I realize fully there's no really redeeming value for,  T V.
A:	Not too much.
B:	No.
A:	Not too much.
A:	Well, that's right.
A:	Well, I think it is good to, to read books and, and, because even if it's, like you say, it's light reading, you are still getting some, uh, mental exercise
B:	Yeah.
B:	You're developing your imagination.
B:	You know, when you develop your imagination, that can take you into a lot of other areas, because you've developed, uh, your, your, your mind in, in seeing things, you know,  even if it's your own set way, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	it's, you're, you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, I mean, It's, it's excellent.
A:	That's good.
B:	I, I'm, we haven't got children yet,
B:	but I hope to, uh, set an example for ours that, you know, that reading is, can, it can be your best friend,  basically.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, even if you haven't got a, a a human friend around, you can pick up a book and, and,  be with somebody, basically.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think so.
A:	Well, I guess I'd better close now so I can,
B:	It sounds like your kids are doing stuff
B:	Or are you a teacher?
A:	Uh,  Well, I, I was.
B:	I gathered you might be a teacher.
A:	I'm home now,  full time.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, so, yeah,
A:	we're, we think books are important around here.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, you have a good day.
B:	Okay.
A:	Stay out of the rain.
B:	Okay.
B:	You too.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Take care.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Yes,
A:	um, how do you feel about, um, the way the U S has reacted in the Middle East?
B:	Well, I was, it was favorable.
B:	I, I just, I think, the sanctions would have worked,
B:	but it would of taken longer
B:	and, uh, now with all this stuff coming out with Woodward's book and everything.
B:	Uh, and then I saw a NIGHTLINE program last night about all the funding of Hussein's, uh, back as early as nineteen eighty-six,
B:	so, uh, been a different turn,
B:	and then I don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It got over so fast,
B:	so, uh,
A:	What is the Woodward book you are referring to?
B:	Well, it just came out, I guess, yesterday.
B:	It's called the COMMANDERS.
B:	And it's, uh, it says, big story in the paper about it today, Bush trying to comment on it, that Colin Powell was against the, uh, uh, an early, uh,
B:	he was for sanctions.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And so it seems like there's, you know, always some body digging things like that.
B:	But, I'm not for sure we know exactly what, what all happened in that situation,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	So, we were so, uh, fast to get over the Vietnam, whatever the Vietnam syndrome is, that now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time.
A:	Right.
A:	That was my feeling.
A:	I was, I was very against our involvement so quickly.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I just think, I think if we had been very, I mean if we had that good of a correlation through the United Nations, then they could have, uh, they could have made sanctions work, I'm pretty sure.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	With that much support, you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo,
A:	Right.
A:	I think we're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned.
B:	We are.
B:	We are, I think, you know,
B:	in, in, we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next, next tenure, for the next thing down the road
B:	and, uh, then, we can, and we don't tend to read Israel correctly
B:	so, uh, I don't know,
B:	it should be a mess.
B:	It's, uh, not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	In spite of all the promises.
B:	Right.
B:	They can talk a good game,
B:	but, uh, being a historian, it's, you know, you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And we just, we're still, I, I you're absolutely right,
B:	too naive,
B:	we just, if we do find so-called experts in any area of the world, we don't listen to them
B:	so, Um, I don't know,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	be, be interesting to keep watching I guess,
B:	but I'm just afraid it's going, it's going,  to break us.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	And I'm not sure we're sensitive to, to other cultures.
B:	Not very much in our colleges,
B:	we're trying,
B:	we're, I happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students
B:	and, and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand
B:	and it needs to be, uh, taught from the earliest grades,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	with our school systems in such disarray, I don't know, if that, it doesn't look terribly hopeful.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	But I'm not sure it's something you can teach.
A:	I mean,  awareness.
B:	Well, you can at least, uh,  give them the awareness of the different cultures and, uh, you know, have all sorts of, um, at least, you know, let them know what that, that other people do things differently than, than, than maybe in their own neighborhood.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	So, and when, when, when those people are around
B:	and you can get them to meet
B:	and we're all pretty much alike,
A:	That's true.
A:	That's true.
B:	So, uh, But it's, uh, it's something as, you know, as I said won't go away,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time
B:	Because I teach history,
B:	so.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	And, um, what about the whole situation with the refugees, the Kurds?
B:	Well, I would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war, then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to, uh, uh, somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a homeland
B:	they were promised that .
A:	But, what about the Palestinians?
B:	Well, that's the same thing,
B:	they, uh, they haven't been waiting quite as long, even though they've been waiting since forty-eight,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	uh, that, that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with Israel
B:	and they seem to be more intractable than ever.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, that Shamir can't, can't retain his leadership if he, if he backs down the slightest bit
B:	so, uh, I just don't see us, I don't think there's anybody of, of major stature on the scene of, like the great statesman of the past,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh
B:	or at least we thought they were.
B:	I'm not for sure that they were.
B:	They seem to have gotten us into some of these messes.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Well, do you think the U S should even be involved? I mean, as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues
A:	or should we have just stayed out of it?
B:	Well, I wish we could stay out of it,
B:	but the oil is not going to allow us to.
B:	We absolutely need that oil.
B:	That's the major thing.
B:	If we didn't need the oil and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis, we could probably stay out of it.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	But I'm not for sure that we're not destined, at least for the foreseeable future, as long as we can keep our head, our own head above water, to be the world leader.
B:	So I, Bush is probably, if he can keep that correlation together, especially the French, and the British, and the Germans, and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money.
B:	They may just have to,
B:	I don't know what type of pressure they can put on all the nations there, too, because now that the war is over, societies have just about gone back to their own,  uh, uh, cold selves.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And I wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis,
B:	they, uh, they're, nobody likes them in that part of the world
B:	but, uh, it's just such a volatile area,
B:	I mean, there's just no stability, period.
A:	Right.
A:	But in a sense, I don't know that I would say it's good,
A:	in a sense I'm glad that Saudi wasn't more changed by, by the situation
A:	because,  I mean, we really don't, I mean, I don't think, it's our world to westernize the whole world,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	so the fact that the Saudi could just sort of pull back and, uh, remain, you know, culturally sort of clean is interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think you're right.
B:	I, it's not our, uh, role to make everybody like us.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But, it's just, uh, for those who have, may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age I am, it's going to eliminate that for awhile.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	I think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there.
A:	Well, you know, I mean, I actually lived in Beirut from sixty-eight to eighty-four is echoing to point of
B:	Oh, did you?
A:	And so, I mean, it's been dangerous for sometime.
B:	Yes.
A:	I'm not sure that it's changed that much.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I, I haven't been to Beirut
B:	but I've heard what a wonderful city that,
B:	it's just totally gone to, uh,
A:	Well, see that's it.
A:	It really hasn't.
B:	It hasn't .
A:	Exactly,
A:	it depends on whether one talks physical or, or sort of cultural.
A:	Culturally, I mean, it's obviously changed a lot.
A:	Because it's more of a survival city ,
A:	but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful, you know, you know.
A:	There was garbage on the corner when I got there
A:	and there's garbage when I left.
A:	But I mean, it's just a different cultural aspect.
A:	I mean, the trucks don't come daily
A:	and you really don't want the garbage in your house,
A:	so. And, I mean, I traveled in the area, too.
A:	And, um, so that many of the countries Turkey and Syria are the same as they were for traveling.
B:	That's one part of the world,
B:	I've been to north Africa a lot but not, um,
B:	I haven't been to Beirut or Syria or Baghdad,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I was never able to go to Baghdad.
A:	It was, I never could get a visa.
A:	So even before, so even when things were good in the Middle East, Americans weren't really given visas to go into Baghdad.
B:	Right.
A:	And, um, but it's, it's a very beautiful part, very interesting historically, of course, which was my interest art history.
B:	Sure.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Well, I think we've done them a good job today then. For this little project they're doing.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	In fact, I just talked to the director awhile ago,
B:	so, uh, he was checking to see if I was going to stay in because I've been so busy with this presidential search,
B:	I haven't had a chance to,  really do any calling myself.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	I see.
A:	I see.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Then great
A:	and, um, you know, have a good business trip.
B:	Thank you.
B:	And you continue .
A:	Okay,
A:	thank you.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right.
B:	in Yes,
B:	I think we're terribly taxed.
B:	I, I think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats,
B:	and I don't think there's a change between one party than the other.
B:	Uh, I think we get a lot back,
B:	but not as much as we should.
A:	Uh, I guess what I feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it, there's got to be something.
A:	When, when we pay so much for the, for the debt, instead of using the money for where  it ought to go, it, it's just, it's ridiculous.
B:	Right.
A:	What kills me is when they had a chance to, to, uh, put into action the, the the
A:	what is it, uh, the act where they had to cut everything across the board
B:	The Gramm, the Gramm Rudman Act.
B:	Yeah.
A:	they kept doing, they kept putting off doing that.
A:	Why did they do that?
A:	That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I think they spend too much.
B:	They, they spend too much on themselves, too,
B:	the, the, A lot of the, the taxes gets back to the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years, rather than.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I think so too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well. Things like mailings.
A:	They don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things.
A:	They just think once they get there that they can do just anything.
A:	No,
A:	they don't, they don't try to, uh to conserve.
B:	No,
B:	you're right.
A:	And of course, here at home, we end up conserving and conserving
A:	and, I mean, when I don't have money, I don't buy something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no
B:	I think, uh, it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, uh,
A:	They sure don't seem to.
B:	The national debt is terrible.
B:	Uh,
A:	There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for,
A:	and I don't know quite how to do it.
A:	But I think we need to have the one line, uh, uh, veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything.
A:	If it's a good idea  it can be done again.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You know, and if it's not, so what.
A:	At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months.
B:	I saw one on TWENTY TWENTY about a month ago I guess, whereas one, I think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that.
B:	Maybe it was, uh, Connecticut,
B:	I'm not sure,
B:	one of the small states up there, where he had a bill through for another, uh, a drug agency that would be located there,
B:	and he was the only one that wanted it.
B:	Was going to cost millions of dollars.
B:	The drug agency didn't want it,
B:	and he was going to build it in his home town
B:	and they were going to hire a lot of people,
B:	and it was ridiculous, you know, the whole thing
A:	Yeah,
A:	this is, that's right.
B:	And, and, you know, they asked him about it.
B:	Do you really need this?
B:	This is going to cost a lot of money.
B:	Oh yes
B:	we need it.
B:	But do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they do things that are, you know, just like the, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on.
B:	Yeah
B:	that.
A:	And the trouble is, you don't, you have so little input about it.
A:	You don't know  enough to know what, what to do about some of this stuff.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	I,
B:	They're supposed to do what we say,
B:	but they do what they, they want to do with it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right.
A:	The other thing about is I think, uh, limiting their time in office would be good.
A:	I, I just  can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got.
B:	Absolutely,
B:	absolutely.
B:	We need to get that through.
B:	We, we have said that, I've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two two terms is enough for all of them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, I think. Certainly President, that, uh, two terms is plenty.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's right.
B:	And then we get these professionals out of there,
B:	and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves, you know, rather than  living off of us.
A:	Yeah,
A:	wouldn't that be too bad
A:	Well, that's right.
A:	I think,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I think, uh, people in general,
A:	the, the, the idea of what you need to, to exist is so outrageous that it's not  hardly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, it starts at the courts,
A:	it starts everywhere until we can't, we've just lost control of, of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, it's so much money
B:	and you can't even add it up, you know,
A:	No,
A:	you can't even,  can't even conceive of what they're talking about.
B:	that's why they think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Our national  debt in the trillions of dollars, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean it and, and you just,
A:	the other thing is, it's, it's all very well to give money to help people, other people,
A:	and I think we need to do that.
A:	But there are, they need to put more limits on them.
A:	They need to restrain  about what they do.
B:	Foreign aid,
B:	yeah.
B:	Foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely necessary.
A:	Yeah
B:	They, they've given that away for fifty years.
A:	I, I, you know, I think that's probably, unless we can afford it,
A:	if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again.
B:	I agree,
B:	I agree.
A:	You know, I don't really mind helping people,
A:	but you, you need to get rid of this thing that's, that's just, uh, eating us up you know, and get things on a, on an even,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	if it were, if it were a family, we'd be up before the, the magistrate for, for doing all these wicked things, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	but the government does it,
A:	and it's all right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I know we're taxed to death on every, every thing.
B:	I don't know what's the best way to do it,
B:	but, uh, they don't even talk about that.
B:	They just raise it.
B:	They don't even consider it, like you saying  to cut something back, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	Well, sounds like.
B:	They are at least doing something now, with the, the military, you know,
B:	they're cutting some of that,
B:	but of course, now, you know T I,
B:	you know that's hurting us but although,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's good to see them doing some things there anyway.
B:	But T I has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else.
B:	And if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic, uh weapon systems.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, that's the only good that I've seen Congress do, you know, and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody, uh,
A:	Well.
A:	I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet.
A:	And we're all going to have to do it.
A:	I, it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	That's why I thought, well, you know, this is the time.
A:	They need to put that into into action and show they mean business. That they've got to cut, they've got to cut costs.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The only taxes I think that are well spent,
B:	well not the only, but, uh,
B:	I think the, now I, I don't understand the present school thing,
B:	but, uh, I have two daughters,
B:	one's in college already,
B:	and one's about to be in high school.
B:	But uh, I think that paying for school, schools is the, schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime.
B:	And so I don't mind paying for school  taxes even though my kids will be out of it, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's right.
A:	Well, I don't, I don't really mind paying taxes for, for positive things that are helps, like roads and making sure that, uh, that water is safe, and some of these things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, you know, it, you just feel like it's out of control.
A:	You feel like  they do not have control of it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The spending is out of control.
A:	And that, and so then it just aggravates you, you know,
A:	you think, I could spend my money,
A:	I could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, I agree with you.
A:	So it's,
B:	I, I think that's a wide open subject what you said.
A:	Yeah.
B:	People need to take a stand.
B:	I think the people will here shortly, uh.
A:	Well, I think that's right.
A:	If they don't do, if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, I think they're really going to have to I think.
B:	I think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, that, what they did last election,
B:	and, uh, ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in, you know,
B:	so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes, you know.
B:	They're supposed to represent us.
B:	That's what they're called
A:	Yeah.
B:	but they don't.
A:	Yeah
B:	May, may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are.
A:	Yeah,
A:	in some ways we're awful lucky I guess.
A:	There a lot of, lot of places where it's worse than it is here.
A:	But still, you don't want it to get that bad, good heavens.
B:	I know,
B:	but it.
B:	No,
B:	that's right,
B:	you don't want to,
A:	No,
B:	you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be.
A:	we need to get, try to get hold of it and, and have it be, things be honest
A:	and, I guess, in the fact I don't really mind paying taxes.
A:	But I would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent. That they're doing something that's positive for for somebody.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't really feel like, uh, I don't really feel like I use taxes very much
A:	I don't know
A:	maybe  I do more than I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, you're right.
A:	I guess I do.
A:	I use them in the, in roads and lot of things,
A:	but, uh.
B:	Well I think one of the good ones in the metroplex, uh, in the last say twenty-five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams.
B:	You know, the Corps of Engineers have, uh, soon as they finish a lake, they'll go at, get another one.
B:	And that we haven't had, we've had droughts here in long summers
A:	Yeah.
B:	we've had good water supply,
B:	and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building, looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they've done some good things.
A:	The state actually did some good, good work on that, in that a couple of years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that  about what they had done.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they, they really had done some good, some good work.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think anything for water supply like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	California should do more of that too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there are a lot of places where they're in real trouble,
A:	and and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too, if they don't take, if they don't take that early stand.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	They just finished Joe Poole Lake over here,
B:	and they need to start another one.
B:	I think every time they finish one they ought to just have  another one in line.
A:	Yeah
B:	The water's critical.
A:	that's probably right.
A:	The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something til they need them.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, it's good to talk to you.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah.
B:	How many calls have you made?
A:	Oh, about nine.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	I'm up to twenty.
B:	Are you a T I
A:	No,
A:	I just, just a housewife.
A:	I just heard about it and found it fun
B:	Oh, well, great,
B:	great,
B:	okay.
A:	Guess I like to talk, that's all
B:	Well, it's been some interesting subjects,
B:	yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	Thanks for calling.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Bye now
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, did you get a chance to watch any of the games?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	I, I just kind of, I, I kind of watch them on the news
B:	and that's about it.
A:	Oh, okay
B:	Uh, the, Michael Jordan's on Chicago Bulls isn't he.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What, did he get hurt last night
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	I don't think so
A:	because, uh, I saw just a little bit of the game today
A:	and he was out there playing.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Although, uh, I, what I saw was at the end of the first quarter,
A:	I think he only had like eight points at the end of the first quarter,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they thought that was big news.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, I don't know,
A:	but I don't know who won,
A:	and, uh, I don't know,
A:	who do you normally pull for, the, the Mavericks or,
B:	No,
B:	I kind of feel like the, about the Mavericks the way I do about the Cowboys now.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, just all this Roy Tarpley stuff
B:	and, and, uh, what is it
B:	their, you know, he got, he's in trouble again down in Houston
B:	and, and, uh, they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him, you know, if they don't trade him, they'll have to pay him off, you know.
B:	So they're rather have him, except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon, and, and, and have some chance of him playing, you know, earning his money.
A:	Oh, jeez.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because that's just dollars right out of the franchise.
B:	Sure is.
A:	Oh, man.
A:	Now I, uh, I, I've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, uh,  not just, not just because they always win,
B:	They're consistent.
A:	but, uh, when they had, uh, Akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well, you know, I just kind of had to go with them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and, uh, course, uh, all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in, in California.
A:	Uh, and it also helps when they were winning
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, they play better as a team than anybody else, seems like.
A:	I was, uh, I always wondered that, you know,
A:	I, I will take a look at the individual score, you know, in the individual stance in the N B A
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, they, they have in the paper, you know, like fifteen different categories
A:	and they'll have, like, a individuals, uh, they'll have the, the highest scorer, the top rebounders, uh, assists, foul shooting percentages and all that,
A:	and you go down through
A:	and virtually every one of the categories there isn't, uh, a Laker in the top ten
A:	usually hardly any, any, anybody in the top twenty except for, like, Magic
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, yet the Lakers continue to win.
A:	So, you're right,
A:	I think they do really play much better as a team than they do, uh, uh, each one, you know, individually at their spot
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	year in and year out, it's not like they have, you know,
B:	a lot of teams will, will, will win in the playoffs
B:	and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff, to, to concentrate on the game.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I understand that, uh,
A:	I guess Boston's really, uh, giving, uh,
A:	are, aren't they playing Detroit?
A:	I think Boston's playing Detroit
A:	and I think they're really giving them a run for their money.
B:	Yeah,
B:	except Larry Bird's hurt.
A:	Did he get hurt again?
B:	He, his back is bad all the time now, I think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I tell you what,
A:	I guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they play two or three times a week. Like, you know,
B:	and then they go on road trips
B:	and they do the same thing
B:	and, and then they, and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time.
B:	So, it really gets, you know,
B:	I mean they're sleeping in different bed every night
B:	and and I imagine that really helps his back.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	He ought to have his own bed come along with him, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he said, he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks,
B:	so, you know, and he's the one that's always winning the, uh, the, the outside, the three point shot
B:	and he does that every year.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	matter of fact, I watched him, uh, on T V, you know, sink, I don't know a,
A:	jeez, it was like, uh, uh, thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Unbelievable.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, I don't know,
A:	did you ever play much basketball?
B:	Not much.
B:	Just, uh, just, just playing horse and stuff like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because it's, it kind of a violent game.
A:	It really is for a noncontact sport,  quote, unquote.
B:	And they
B:	Yeah,
B:	and they don't wear any pads .
A:	Yeah,
A:	really
B:	I figured,
A:	Some of those guys got pretty funny looking, uh, eye wear.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They have to wear goggles because they get hit in the, in the face with elbows all the time.
A:	Man.
B:	Well, it's it's, I was looking in the paper for something on it
B:	and here's the top N B A draft prospects
B:	and, uh, I mean they're all the size of football players, you know, except they're just taller.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Several years ago when I was up in, uh, Cleveland, I was staying at the Marriott
A:	and the Cavaliers were playing somebody.
A:	I think it was like Utah or somebody like that
A:	and, uh, I was down by the pool
A:	and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water.
A:	Now I wear, uh, contacts,
A:	and I, I had my glasses on
A:	and I went down there and, and just jumped into the water where they were
A:	and it went right up over my head
A:	and I came up spittering and sputtering for air
A:	and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they were all like, uh, like six eight and, uh, you know, six ten,
A:	and they were standing in water that was like six foot,  you know,
B:	Six foot,
B:	yeah.
A:	and it was, uh, it was funny, I tell you.
A:	I saw, I saw a guy,
A:	I don't remember what his name was,
A:	but he got on the elevator
A:	and he had his swimsuit on
A:	and, uh, he was just skin and bones, you know,
A:	it looked like something out of Africa
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I made some comment
A:	and, uh, he says, yeah,
A:	he says I weigh about, uh, uh, two hundred and forty pounds
B:	Yeah.
A:	but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
A:	So, you're right,
A:	those guys really, you know, the, the big ones,
A:	I don't even know how much Ewing weighs.
A:	But, uh, he's got to be way up there.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, here's a, here's a guy from L S U, Stanley Roberts,
B:	he's seven feet tall
B:	and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds.
B:	So,
A:	God. That's a, that's a lot
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's a lot of, a lot of guy coming down on you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Jeez.
A:	I didn't even see,
A:	who's, who's supposed to have the, the, uh, the best, uh, draft picks?
B:	It doesn't even say.
B:	It doesn't say,
B:	here it says, uh, it says
B:	the this is for underclassmen for June twenty-six
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, I guess, I guess they don't, they have, they, they, uh, have a lottery on it.
B:	They pick numbers
B:	and that's how they take them in order.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	It must not be according to their, how they did during the year.
A:	I used to go down to Reunion Arena, uh,
A:	went down there a couple years on the day of the draft
B:	Uh-uh.
A:	and that was really pretty interesting.
A:	They usually have, uh, uh, you know, a video, uh, highlights of the season, you know, and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage, both the good and the bad
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I don't know,
A:	I haven't, I didn't go down there last year,
A:	but, uh, it, it was only like a couple dollars to get in
A:	and it was really kind of interesting
A:	But, uh, so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs?
B:	I don't know,
B:	who's going,
B:	is it Chicago and,
A:	Chicago, uh, and, let's see, uh, Golden State and the Lakers and, Chicago and Philadelphia,
A:	think Chicago's playing Philadelphia
A:	and then the, uh,
A:	shoot, I can't remember them all now.
B:	Utah, Portland, Boston and Detroit.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	That's the N B A?
A:	N B A playoffs,
A:	Philadelphia was, uh, favored by one point over Chicago and the Lakers one point over Golden State, and Detroit by five over, uh, Boston
A:	Jeez.
B:	I think Boston, Boston will win.
A:	Think so?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I tell you what,
A:	those guys really hang tough.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, I, I'd like to see them back up there again.
A:	They really, uh, they really gave some, some really good years of, uh, uh, of enjoyment and fun and everything.
A:	Have you ever been up there to Boston Garden?
B:	Oh, no,
B:	uh,
A:	Well, I don't know
A:	is that in,
A:	I, I haven't really gone to a lot of games live,
A:	but boy I'd sure like to.
A:	Basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
B:	How's the weather been out there?
A:	Well, the last three days it's been pretty rainy.
A:	We went to the beach
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it started, uh, let's see, around four o'clock,
A:	and, uh, it had thunder and lightning,
A:	it was, and then, you know, it was just overcast and rainy for, uh, the next two or three days straight.
A:	How about yours?
B:	It's pretty normal for this year, you know, uh,
B:	they have tornados about once a week,
B:	and it rains about every three days.
B:	The last two years before, they've had record rainfall.
B:	By this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year,
B:	but this time we're only, um, I think, maybe five inches ahead of, of, uh, normal.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's not been bad at all.
A:	You're from Virginia?
B:	I'm from Texas.
A:	Oh, from Texas.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh
A:	I heard they had some flooding down there.
B:	Um, they had some flooding in Houston the other day, real, real bad over, I think it was over the weekend.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	The radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, the last couple of years, we're, um, we're over as far as our rainfall goes.
A:	Before that it was really dry,
A:	and, uh, everybody was, you know, talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that.
A:	Not really rationing water, but just cutting down.
B:	that's, that's right.
A:	And, uh, it seems like, uh, you know, the weather pattern is just shifting, and, uh, that, uh, jet stream is moving, uh, into our area, North Carolina and across,
B:	There
A:	but it's, uh, changing latitude.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	so you get a lot more rain that way.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Brings in that cold air
B:	and mixes it with the, with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's what,
A:	It's finally cleared up.
A:	It's just now still a little overcast,
A:	but the but the sun has finally started popping out.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is the temperature like sixties to eighties there too,
B:	or,
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	well, right now, as a matter of fact I'm fixing to go play tennis.
A:	It's, um, I'd say it's at least seventy-nine, eighty, well, about seventy-eight, seventy-nine degrees.
B:	Um, do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean
B:	or,
A:	Um, actually the, uh, the wind normally blows, let's see, let me think about this, south, southwest.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, but but actually our, I guess our weather pattern comes from the, uh, blows north east,
A:	yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you're right,
A:	it blows north east.
B:	That's the way it does here most of the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, sometimes it just comes straight from the north
B:	and then it, and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston, or, or, uh, maybe mid, mid-Texas
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	depends on how strong the cold fronts are.
A:	How how far are you from Houston?
B:	Um, well, uh, Richardson's a suburb of Dallas.
A:	Oh, I see,
A:	so you, so you don't you don't get anything off the Gulf, uh, immediately from, from the ocean.
B:	Hardly ever, unless there's a hurricane or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, uh, it's kind of early
B:	I was going to say, the weather man on, on, uh, one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather,
B:	and he was afraid if it kept doing that, that they'd have early hurricanes this year.
A:	Um. Well, we've had some, you know, pretty, pretty rough winds.
A:	Oh, uh, Bangladesh, boy, they, they caught it bad
B:	Yeah.
B:	Kind of wiped them
A:	But we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes.
A:	I know, uh, Hurricane Hugo,
A:	you probably heard about that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, last year.
B:	Wiped everything out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they're still, uh, rebuilding from that storm,
A:	and so the, the beaches here just get really beat up
A:	and it usually comes this way
B:	Yeah.
A:	It comes up from, uh, Miami uh, down around, or, you know, around the Bahamas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it usually travels, uh, northwest,
A:	and, uh, it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits.
B:	Do do you get many tornados this time of year
B:	or,
A:	Um, let's see,
A:	two years ago we had one,
A:	as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house.
B:	Um.
A:	And, um, it was real odd.
A:	The barometric pressure drops during a tornado,
A:	and our, uh, fire alarm went off.
B:	Huh.
A:	So of course that woke everybody up,
A:	and we knew what was going on, to, uh, you know, go downstairs or go into the bathroom and, uh, take cover.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, we get, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	we're, we're, uh, we get our share of tornados.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, the, uh, uh,
B:	you, you aren't in the mountains or anything like that, are you?
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
B:	There's just there's just hills.
A:	We're about two hours from the beach.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, you know, it's, uh, barometric pressure I believe is higher in the mountains,
A:	and we we catch some winds, you know, a few winds coming off of them, I think.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, let's see,
A:	you all just had a tornado, uh, over close to Oklahoma and Texas?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they, they had a lot of them.
B:	They had a, a huge one that was on, um, INSIDE EDITION the other night, in, uh, the southern part of Kansas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, they took a bunch of film of it.
B:	It, uh, kind of chased them.
B:	It was a few hundred yards away
B:	and it chased them under an underpass,
B:	and it was tossing around the car right before it got there,
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	and it tore up the people inside the car.
A:	Oh, did it?
B:	And the the camera man on the news crew held the camera out,
B:	they were hiding underneath the underpass,
B:	and he held the camera out as the tornado went by.
A:	Um.
B:	And the, the wind, you know, it had a mike on it,
B:	and the wind and everything was incredible.
A:	Um. Boy I would have like to have heard that.
A:	That would have been something.
B:	I'm surprised they didn't, they, because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row
B:	and that, and you know, and that was way up in Kansas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But over here, it's a lot, it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I used to live in Amarillo originally.
B:	Yeah
A:	So I'm,
B:	you can really see them well there.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	We used to sit out, uh, especially in Borger, we use to sit out on our back, uh, picnic table and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground.
A:	But otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds.
B:	It's really strange the way it does that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Especially the way it starts.
B:	It starts, you know, just like a little swirl in the clouds,
B:	and, and, uh, then it just grows from there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it, and, and usually it's not even raining when it starts.
B:	It's just.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was,
A:	but the clouds are just really, uh, uh, rolling kind of just real pillowy, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right,
B:	and they're black,
B:	and sometimes they're even green colored.
A:	Oh, well I was in that, uh, big tornado went through Wichita Falls.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, uh, the sky,
A:	I mean, we were right in the middle of it, when, I mean, signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And a whole roof of a restaurant came off.
A:	And, uh, it was a eerie, uh, a real eerie blue-green color.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the lightning was almost continuous, just, uh, you know, as if you put your hand on one of those electric, uh, things that causes lightning.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I think it was called the storm.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's it.
A:	But, um, the the whole sky was full of that eerie blue-green, uh, lightning.
B:	Wow.
B:	And that's about, that's what we get this time of year, just, all the way, sometimes all the way through June,
B:	the last, especially the last two years, it's rained, uh, what, I think it rained nine inches in, in one, one of the Junes the last two years.
A:	Um.
B:	And this year,
B:	we usually get about five inches in May,
B:	and it's, it's over that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We haven't got that much rain,
A:	but, uh, when it rains, it's, it's been downpouring.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	All right,
B:	well I hope you have good weather the rest of the summer.
A:	You, too.
B:	Have fun playing tennis.
A:	Okay,
A:	thanks.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, do you have any advice for college?
A:	I'm, I'm, I'm full of advice.
A:	I'm still a graduate student.
A:	So.
B:	Oh, I watched that movie with, uh, Barbara, uh, uh,
B:	what was her name.
B:	Oh,
B:	that, uh, her sister got killed
B:	and, uh, she had a baby.
B:	The husband was a dentist
B:	and he had murdered her.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	uh, Bertinelli, or what's her name.
B:	That was, that was pretty good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	oh, Valerie Bertinelli.
A:	I can't,
B:	That's it,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was real good,
A:	I saw that one, uh, two part series,
A:	and I heard it was a true story.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and then I saw that other movie about, uh, MOTHER, MOTHER, WIFE, MURDERER.
A:	Did you see that one?
B:	Oh, uh, with, uh, Judith Light?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh,
A:	Did you see that one,
A:	that was, was really good.
A:	That was supposed to be a true story, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did see that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did.
B:	That was on a while ago, wasn't it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I saw that.
A:	Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was pretty good.
A:	Boy we have we, we see all the same movies.
B:	I,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I like, uh, the true stories.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They're more interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened.
A:	I know.
B:	Some of them are pretty bad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Huh. Well We sure do have a lot in common.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie
B:	Okay
A:	But, and we don't really,
A:	do you all have, do you all still have drive-ins up there
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	do you have them there?
A:	Um, well, we may have just a couple over here.
A:	Okay Brian.
B:	Hi,
B:	how you doing Kevin?
A:	Fine, thanks
B:	Good,
B:	good,
B:	glad to hear that.
B:	I understand,
A:	Are you a total banner?
B:	Total banner?
A:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	I, I believe that, uh, the American public and I, as an individual and private citizen have a right to, to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I, uh, am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids
B:	and, and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.
B:	I think that education with a gun is, is critical and important.
B:	Uh, however, I do believe that, uh, guns ought to be maintained and, and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns
B:	and in the heat of the moment, they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people,
B:	so on a scale of one to ten, I, I think I would rate myself as a, in the six or seven or eight.
A:	Okay.
B:	But, I think that there ought to be some control,
B:	but I still think that, uh, individuals have a right.
B:	How do you feel about it?
A:	Well, so, let me make sure,
A:	so you think that, uh, maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate?
B:	Well, I don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate.
B:	Uh, that, uh, that might cool down some tempers.
B:	I think a, a one day would be sufficient.
B:	The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows
B:	and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun, if that five day waiting period were in effect, you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show.
A:	Uh, you just, you would be able to buy it,
A:	but they'd just have to mail it to you, I suppose, huh.
B:	Well, I don't think you can mail thing, guns through the mail.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Oh.
A:	Okay.
B:	I think that's a, against the law ever since Kennedy was assassinated
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	So, how do you feel about guns?
A:	Let's see,
A:	I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns
A:	and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	whether, you know,
B:	Well, do you think that there will continue to always be crazies?
A:	Sure.
B:	Then, uh, how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns?
A:	Well, we have some laws on the books that, uh, don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns, if I understand correctly.
A:	And, uh, I would agree,
A:	a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things,
A:	but uh, I think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a, a bit on the extreme side.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.
B:	Okay.
B:	Do you, uh, do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a, an automatic handgun?
A:	The only purpose for handguns is to shoot people, in my opinion.
A:	or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,
A:	but, uh,
B:	Well, I think that the, the police, uh, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,
B:	but, the public, I don't know.
A:	I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Not a automatic, semiautomatic.
B:	Yes,
B:	not an Uzi
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	Uh, but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You saw Indiana Jones,
A:	the guy came after him with that big knife.
B:	Yes.
A:	And just, he took care of it,
A:	just one shot.
B:	Yes,
B:	that's true,
B:	and he, uh, saved himself in the, in the, in the process also.
A:	That's right.
A:	So how is work going?
B:	Very fine,
B:	very,
A:	They don't let you take guns to work, do they?
B:	No,
B:	they, That's, uh, that's prohibited where we work.
B:	Although down here in Texas, uh you do have a right to, to wear and carry arms with you at all times.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's still that's still, you can still do that down here.
A:	Can they be, Is it concealed,
A:	or does it have to,
B:	Oh, you can't,
B:	no,
B:	it should not be concealed.
A:	Has to be on the hip?
B:	It has to be on the hip
B:	Has to be in sight so that, uh, you know, that you're not, uh, a menace or a problem to individuals.
A:	Can a
B:	How about where you live there in Utah?
A:	Okay, Howard,
A:	what do you think of our space budget
A:	and should we go ahead and, and keep exploring,
A:	or should we call a halt to it,
A:	is it doing any good?
B:	I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.
B:	Now I think what, we made a major wrong turn when we went into the, uh, to the current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more, uh, much better in many ways.
B:	However, uh, you know, we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, uh, some new space age materials, plastics and all that.
B:	So I think it's been a good investment.
B:	Uh, somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed  program.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Wish our post office could do that
B:	I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.
A:	That's right.
A:	I wish they'd just deliver stuff.
B:	I think, though, that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the, uh, oh, I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, uh, Challenger,
B:	I think maybe we can  pick up and go on now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I, I don't know.
B:	I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives.
A:	I agree.
B:	The space station's where we should go  at this point.
A:	I agree.
A:	Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor
A:	and, you know, you know, and I'm in favor of, you know, getting closer to seeing certain things,
A:	but I'd like to see them also go, you know, go back up there, see, you know, what they can do. See about setting a space station up.
A:	I'm all in favor of the space program,
A:	and I don't think we should stop,
A:	and I don't think we should cut the money.
B:	Well, where do you think we ought to go with it?
A:	Uh.
B:	You talking about, uh, uh, a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I would like, I'd like to see that.
A:	I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on, even if, you know, there's no life up there or anything, you know.
A:	But who knows.
A:	And I would like to see them do something like that.
B:	Well,
A:	I, I hate to see them just, you know, keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things
A:	and, I think they, I think they lose sight of, of probably what they're supposed to be doing.
B:	Well, I think about half the nations now are, are military related, are they not?
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	And, uh, It seems like it's that high a percentage.
A:	I believe they are.
A:	You know, let's go back to our original thing with, you know, our experiments and all the, you know, our actual exploring of space and, and all that,
A:	and, you know, with, with Russia, uh, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.
B:	Well, it can't afford to
A:	Huh-uh, you know.
A:	Have you gone out to, uh, Fort Worth to see the space, Soviet space exhibit?
B:	No,
B:	we were talking about that this weekend.
B:	We, it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	We need to go.
A:	We went, uh,
A:	we took our grandsons and went, uh, the weekend before last,
A:	and it is marvelous.
A:	I mean, it's really neat how they, they have done it.
A:	They have done a beautiful job.
B:	Have they?
A:	And they have a, uh, scaled down model showing how they, you know, fuel it, or, you know, how they, uh, oh, the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they, uh,
A:	all the things that are against the actual space mission, uh, space ship, you know, how they fall away from it,
A:	and the loading of it
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	and then it's actually, you know,
A:	the smoke comes out like it's taking off.
A:	It is really interesting.
B:	Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.
A:	You really do.
A:	It's, it's well worth the time and effort.
A:	We went, uh, early on Sunday.
A:	We got out there about, uh, ten, ten thirty,
A:	and the,
B:	Now do you have to have tickets ahead?
B:	Excuse me.
A:	No,
A:	we bought tickets there,
A:	and if you have children, if you go to McDonald's, you they have coupons, or did have.
A:	Now they may be through with them now.
A:	But, uh, buy one adult
A:	and one child gets in free.
B:	Um, I think both of my kids are too old for that
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	oh, okay.
B:	they're both, uh,
A:	You have teenagers or something.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	well I had grandchildren so, three of them, so between their mother and their grandfather and I,
A:	because their dad was at work
A:	and, uh, But, and the boys loved it, you know,
B:	Did you,
A:	they really did like it.
B:	It's very impressive, I'm sure.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	it is,
A:	and I felt the, uh, six year old would, you know, that he'd be kind of bored,
A:	but he wasn't.
A:	Even the three year old enjoyed it
A:	because they had one, had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon, and showed it moving around and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it was really neat.
B:	Well, see, that's something else.
B:	The Russians have had space stations, manned space stations for years now.
B:	You know, they had the Merv
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and see we've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, in going through it, I got the impression that actually they were farther ahead,
A:	They're talking about, uh, federal government, aren't they?
B:	I'm sure,
B:	well, actually probably any government,
B:	but the federal one's the big one
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, so what do you, what do you think in the short term we should be doing to, to improve it?
A:	Well, I saw a program on, uh, recently,
A:	and, and it said every time they cut, you know, like fifty-five million dollars on a certain thing, then they brag about how much money they cut,
A:	and then they go and spend that money somewhere else
B:	Right.
A:	and that's why the budget is never balanced.
B:	Right.
A:	The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem.
A:	They just take all the money that they say they cut
A:	and they spend it somewhere else
B:	Yeah.
A:	or they, you know, they pad out their staff, or, you know, spend it in bounced checks at the, commissary,
A:	or.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I'm getting pretty, kind of disgusted with the, uh, uh, you know, the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step.
B:	Right.
B:	I mean, first of all, we were, we've already hit the largest deficit, this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever,
B:	and, two, a deficit is, I mean, the deficit is only, uh, is, is as far from a balanced budget,
B:	you reduce the deficit,
B:	you, you're still not, you're still not, you're still overspending.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	I mean, it's just the amount that you're overspending,
B:	and this is, you know, for some reason, the way that the reporting is going on now,
B:	it seems like, like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some, you know, still outrageous amount, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with, uh, sort of the, the, uh,
B:	well I mean, it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process, right, that you've got, uh, people, you know, trying to, trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, there isn't any sort of overall accountability,
B:	and, and, uh, I don't know,
B:	I, I suppose that, that, that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have, is, is, is exposure and information.
B:	And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested, you know, to listen to, to as much, uh, uh, you know,
B:	I mean, you're going to have to know what people are doing, and, uh, you know, and how, and how, how partisan and how and how self-interested their, their motives are and, and take it to task for it, because it's not going to get solved, you know, if people are still trying, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	like you were saying you say, you know, hey, we just, you know, we just cut defense,
B:	let me grab some of this money for my state now,
B:	and then we can throw in some highway bill,
B:	or you can throw in some, you know, some other kind of thing,
B:	and, uh, it's a pretty vicious, uh, vicious cycle.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, I think they should, they should limit the Senate to one term, one six year term.
B:	That's,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's being batted around.
B:	I, uh, my, my dad was always a proponent of that.
B:	He, uh he felt that that would get people involved who were, who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	and, and don't let them come back,
A:	and, and, uh, keep Congress to, um, two terms of two years a piece
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then it'll be overturning
A:	and they won't have the same people there all the time
B:	Right.
A:	and then, all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks
B:	Right.
A:	and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because that's one of the things, one of the biggest things is that, uh, the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another, whether it's the oil companies, or the automotive companies, and like the air bag thing.
A:	The air bag came out, what, twenty years ago.
B:	Right
A:	And only now they're getting that put in cars.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	And the oil companies are, really aren't responsible, you know.
A:	The Valdez proved that,
A:	and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything.
B:	Right.
A:	It should have been done immediately.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I think, I think that that's probably right,
B:	because in terms of long term, you just got to get people, um,
B:	I mean, uh, at one point, at least on a local level, um, going into politics is, you know, what you're doing is, is really trying to serve the community right,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, you don't expect to make any money out of it.
B:	You know, maybe you gain a little bit of local fame,
B:	but, but it's, uh, you put in a lot of work in exchange for that.
A:	Right.
B:	And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are, are at all like that.
A:	No.
A:	They listen to wherever the money is.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, you know, I think that, that, that the problem with having, you know, junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with, uh, you know, with inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're not as efficient,
A:	that's for sure.
B:	But on the other hand, maybe that's,
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
A:	Um, we have small children, two and four
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we, our dining is very limited
B:	I bet you're McDonald's fan.
A:	Oh, we're past that now.
A:	We're a little sick of that
B:	Are you?
B:	Gosh, where do you go, Whataburger?
A:	No,
A:	um, we're more
A:	like, um, you know, like Wyatt's Cafeteria.
B:	Oh is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that way.
A:	And the kids just love everything that's there,
A:	so we're pretty fortunate.
A:	Kind of, um, buffet style, uh,
A:	so you can  go in and go out
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's good.
A:	and the food's already served
A:	and you don't have to wait,
A:	and it's already in front of them when you sit down,
A:	and things like, um, Souper Salads, you know,
A:	it's, again it's buffet,
A:	and it's already prepared
A:	and just things, any, any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time.
B:	I can understand that.
A:	We,
B:	We got, we got three kids, too,
B:	and when the kids are small, if you going to wait, you don't go out.
A:	No
B:	They won't put up with that.
A:	We tried a Bennigan's one time,
A:	and it was terrible.
A:	Course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway.
A:	We, we waited almost forty-five minutes before everything was brought out,
A:	and it was, we were ready  to go home.
B:	And you had.  And you had the kids with you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they waited forty-five minutes?
A:	No
A:	We fought with them for forty-five minutes.
B:	I don't doubt that one bit.
A:	So, we, we, we rarely go eat in those kind of eating, uh, situations, any more.
A:	But we do love to eat out,
A:	and, um, and we do it as often as we can,
A:	and, and times that we do have baby-sitters we, we try and catch, um, some things that we normally wouldn't do, you know.
B:	Where, where do you like to go when you got a baby-sitter?
A:	Oh, um, let me see, uh, for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's.
B:	Where's that?
B:	Never heard of that place.
A:	It's, um, on, on Walnut and Greenville.
B:	What's the name of that again?
A:	It's called Uncle Julio's.
B:	What, what are they, what kind of?
A:	Um, basically Mexican food.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	And it's supposed to be very similar to, um, uh,
A:	what is that restaurant off of Central?
A:	It's a, um, it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central.
B:	Well, there's a zillion of them.
B:	Have you ever been to Mercado Juarez?
A:	No,
A:	but I've heard about it.
B:	That's a good place
B:	I.
A:	Really.
B:	They've got one in Addison too, now,
B:	but the original was on Northwest Highway, uh, just the other, west of Loop Twelve.
B:	That's a good Mexican place.
A:	Really,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Good, good prices, good, good food there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you like Mexican stuff. It's, it's a good place.
A:	We like, um, seafood, also,
A:	and, uh.
B:	You, you ever been to Vincent's?
A:	Vincent's?
A:	No,
A:	we haven't.
B:	That's a good seafood place.
A:	Really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Really.
B:	You ever been, tried a place called Louisiana Purchase?
A:	No.
B:	Well, this is in Plano.
B:	They might have another one,
B:	but it's on, uh, Parker and Central Expressway
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, it's, it's
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I've seen it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's Cajun type stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you like it kind of hot, that that is good food,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that's good stuff.
A:	We've been to, um, Chefalia's.
A:	It's basically the same thing, seafood Cajun style.
B:	Yes.
B:	Where's that place?
A:	That's in Addison, off of Belt Line.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	Midway.
B:	Belt Line and what?
A:	Like around, I think it's a little past or it's right before Midway, or it's right at Midway.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	And, um, excellent food.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	We got this Premier Dining Card thing,
B:	and we've, we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it.
A:	What, what is that?
B:	Well, you get, uh, one free
B:	and you, you, you pay for one now, and type thing,
A:	Oh, really.
B:	and, uh, We've been to from barbecue to,
A:	Oh.
B:	there's a Swan Club which is out Central and Campbell.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that is, if you like continental stuff, that is really nice.
B:	Talk, talk your husband into taking you there some night.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean it's not a cheap place,
B:	but, uh, it's very nice.
A:	Really.
A:	And where is that?
B:	Uh, it's on Campbell. It, it's north of Campbell, but, uh, off Central, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	oh, it used to be a Northern Telecom Building in the in the ground floor.
B:	I don't know what they call it now,
B:	Northern Telecom kind of moved over in their own building.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But it, it's a big, tall, it's the tallest building on the west side, northwest side of Campbell and, just before you get to Campbell
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's in the lower floor,
B:	but it's really a nice restaurant if you like Continental stuff.
A:	Really.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, tell him to take you there for your anniversary,
B:	and then they got a place where you can dance, you know, and all that kind of stuff.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, my birthday's coming up,
A:	so.
B:	There you go.
B:	All right.
B:	You got one coming.
A:	I need an excuse
B:	Have you ever been to Ewaldes
B:	now there's, if you like
B:	I, I like Continental stuff, myself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My wife doesn't necessary like that stuff,
B:	but I like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's down in the, the Stoneleigh Hotel now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that is really super kind of stuff, too. Take, if you like Continental at all that kind of stuff
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	either one of those two, you go through a hundred bucks without half trying,
B:	but it, it's it's nice, really nice place.
A:	Oh, oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, you don't have to spend that much,
B:	I'm kidding you.
A:	I pushed it.
B:	Okay.
A:	So, how do you use your credit cards?
B:	Oh, we use them for, paying our gas and for paying, uh, just about anything, because, um, we don't like to pay for our checks
B:	So we use it quite a bit
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we, we pay off every month, though,
B:	so we never have to pay interest
B:	and we always, we never get the, the credit cards if there's a monthly, or a yearly charge.
B:	We always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free.
B:	So we never have to pay anything extra.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's me.
A:	I won't use one that I have to pay an annual fee
B:	Yeah,
B:	we just don't think it's worth it.
B:	So.
A:	you know, and, um, I'm, uh, like you. I, I use it, well, to buy my gas with,
A:	my my Shell credit card, I use that,
A:	and then like my Emporium card and, uh, Weinstocks card, I use that,
A:	but I'm like you.
A:	I usually pay it off as soon as I get my bill.
A:	Why I don't just write a check, I don't know.
B:	See, well, you, I don't do it either
A:	You know, it's just really weird,
A:	but I, I don't carry a lot of cash with me, because I'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yes,
B:	exactly,
B:	that's how I
B:	I mean, it's a rare day when I even have seventy-five cents in my purse.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, enough for a phone call
A:	and that's about all.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, other than that, that's the, that's the way I use them.
A:	I know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got, they they can't charge any more, you know,
A:	and I think that's terrible.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because it's really, it helps your, if you have good credit, you know, it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a  bigger purchase or something.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because if anything ever happens that you do need to, you know, you have excellent credit,
A:	why, it really does help.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases,
B:	like whenever we go on trips, we always, you know, use our, our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then, um, you know, we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it,
B:	we come out a even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever, first off, and then pay  for it later.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.
B:	Yeah,
B:	even if it's five bucks, even.
A:	I know.
A:	It just, uh, you know, it just seems like they're, somebody's always watching.
A:	So, I just don't, I don't carry money.
A:	I'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And also, if you, if someone did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, you know, you notice it within, I think it's twenty-four hours, you can report it in,
B:	and I, he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, you know, whatever payments you had,
B:	and if whoever tried to, uh, you know, credit it to the hilt, you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it,
A:	Right.
B:	and then you know, you can have your card back with pretty good rating, you know, because you can pay fifty dollars, but not, you know  maybe five thousand or whatever.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	And, you know, some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything you know,
B:	I know.
A:	I don't know why they don't, unless you have to spend a certain
A:	I don't know,
A:	but I notice that some of them don't even look, you know,
A:	they just slide it in there and pass it back to you you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	so I don't think that's right.
A:	I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	sure.
B:	I mean it's just a precaution for everybody.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so.
A:	Well, let's see,
A:	what else can I say about credit cards.
B:	Um.
A:	Um.
B:	Oh, I also use, like to use Discover when I can, because they give you some money back every year.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't, I don't, uh,
A:	that, that's that Sears Discovery Card,
A:	is that what that?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now I don't have that one, you know.
B:	Well, we just started doing that,
B:	and  you know, what
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it comes in handy for when you're buying things like, um, tickets for the train or, um, airplanes because they'll give you some money back, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's only a little bit,
B:	but, I mean, it's still something.
B:	We got two fifty last year
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and so it's, you know, it helps out here and there.
B:	So.
A:	Oh, you mean, uh, for, for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they give you, I think they start giving you like a half a percent back, which doesn't sound like a thing,
B:	but when you, you know, when you add up everything you've, you've charged up on the Discover card for a year
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they give you a half percent of that,
B:	and that adds up to, you know, two fifty or something.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	And so that's what,
B:	and I know we're going to get back more this year, because they, you know, we spent a little bit more probably,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they do it for how long you've been a member I think, too
A:	Um, I see.
B:	and they increase the percentage a little bit.
A:	Yeah
A:	well, I'll,
A:	I'm ready.
B:	All right.
A:	Do you exercise, uh, during the day time or go to a gym or anything?
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I used to go to a gym, um, last summer,
B:	but then I started school again,
B:	so, it's, um, so I don't exercise as much as I'd like.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I, I do enjoy, um, going to a gym and working out,
B:	or just like, I do sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up,
B:	and I ride a exercise bike a lot.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, it's really weird,
A:	because I'll get down on the floor,
A:	and I'll holler and tell my cat Nikki,
A:	I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises, now.
A:	And she can be upstairs in the bedroom,
A:	and I don't know.
A:	She knows what I'm talking about.
A:	You know, pretty soon, here she comes.
A:	So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I had a problem with my back,
A:	so, when I went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then, then my back gives me a problem again.
B:	Right.
A:	So I try to do it every night,
A:	and uh.
B:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it seems like it's, you know,
A:	I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so you know it's got to be good for you.
B:	Right
A:	But, um, a long time ago I belonged to a gym
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they do have a, a gym that just opened up here about a month ago.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, I was kind of thinking about joining it,
A:	but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, it does really make you feel good,
A:	and I like to bicycle, too.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, that gives you, you know, lots of exercise.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	I enjoy that a lot.
B:	I, um, bike in the summer.
B:	I belong to a biking club here in Kenosha.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, we go on a, like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	So I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so, I, you know, can be in shape .
A:	Yeah,
A:	otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far, huh?
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
B:	No,
B:	I go with my dad.
B:	He exercises a lot more than I do, though.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	he's  always exercising.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I'm not that energetic
A:	Yeah.
B:	I get lazy sometimes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, like I say, I just do it at night, you know,
A:	and, um.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you like you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that's what I like to do.
A:	You know, because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape,
A:	and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape  you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I've just been doing it, I try to do it every night you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know
B:	Oh.
B:	Wow
A:	So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that is neat
A:	You know, so. Well, I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising.
A:	I wish I knew how to swim,
A:	but I don't,
A:	so I don't go swimming.
B:	Yeah,
B:	um, I don't swim much, neither.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	but they do say that swimming is really, really good for you you know, for every part of your body.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I wished I, I wished I did know how to do that.
A:	If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably, you know, put my bathing suit on and go down there,
A:	but they don't have a pool in this small city, either.
B:	Oh. Um.
A:	So. Well, listen then,
A:	it's been nice talking to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	nice talking to you.
A:	Okay then.
B:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Um, bye.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you, uh, do any woodworking?
B:	I do,
B:	and I really love it. Um.
A:	Oh, um, what do you do,
A:	for a hobby or for,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I do it for a hobby
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have my own equipment,
B:	and I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and, uh, in the process of getting a router
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that I cut out.
B:	What kind of things do you like to do with wood?
A:	Well, I'm not the one that cuts them out.
A:	My husband cuts them out
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw is, is a lot slower
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, uh, he's got a router,
A:	but now he wants a plunge router.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But anyhow, he cuts them out,
A:	and then I, I took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right, you know.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what we want to do is, you know, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and and see if we can sell some of them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	But, uh, I really like it so far.
B:	Oh, that is fun.
A:	And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I took a pattern off of that,
A:	and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you, you make the dress for it,
A:	and you drill holes around the top of the head
A:	and you, you stick in uh, like rope and tie ribbons around it.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	the twine.
B:	Yeah,
B:	those are so cute.
A:	It looked really cute, you know.
A:	So I've got a couple of those started.
B:	They are really cute.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then uh, but as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing right now.
B:	Oh, that is, that sounds really fun.
B:	well, they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden, Utah
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just got back from that today,
B:	so if you could get your projects into boutiques, oh, they are wonderful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You could make a lot of money from those.
A:	What do you do?
A:	I wonder how you,
A:	you just, they buy them from you,
A:	or you just given them to them on consignment or something?
B:	Uh, apparently,
B:	like that boutique, um, they take, oh what was it, twenty percent of the sell price.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You would put your sell price
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter.
A:	Um, I see.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And so then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then they give you what you earned
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So, you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit.
A:	Oh, these little things are so cute, though, you know.
B:	They are.
A:	I.
B:	I, I have seen those.
B:	Those are darling.
A:	I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out.
A:	In fact, I just sent to Shop Smith  back in Ohio for a rocking horse pattern.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, that's what I want, is a Shop Smith
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, well,  Gene's got one of those too
B:	That's my
B:	Oh, does he?
B:	Oh, that's my ultimate dream
A:	Yeah,
A:	so anyhow.
B:	Oh, you're lucky.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, uh, he's retired now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I'm kind of semi retired.
A:	My company went bankruptcy,
A:	so I'm drawing my pension from them,
A:	but I'm still looking for a part time job, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, he has all day long that he can, you know, work on this stuff and do do cut outs like that, you know.
B:	Oh.
B:	How fun.
A:	And he's got a lot, a lot of tools,
B:	Oh, how nice.
B:	I'm jealous.
B:	Yes.
A:	But, um, these little wooden things, they seem to sell really good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I know a lot of people that have gotten them, you know.
A:	My next door neighbor, every time she sees something, she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, I'm just hoping that, you know, that we can get some cut out and painted, you know, before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh.
B:	Well, how is the market for things like that in California?
A:	It seems, it seems like they go real good, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, the country, anyhow, out here
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I live out in the valley
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and country seems to be the in thing out here you know,
B:	Oh.
A:	everybody wants little country pieces.
A:	So anything that looks like it might be country is what they want, you know.
B:	They just snap it right up, huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, this little rabbit that I made in, uh, tole painting class, you know, is like a welcome.
A:	It's got a, it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it, in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	And,
A:	Well, uh, preferred benefits, uh,
A:	I worked for a large corporation in the past
A:	and I think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because, right now I'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there
A:	and, uh, there is a lot of profit that's coming in
A:	but when it comes to, uh, small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick, quickly, or whatever, or however you want to say it
A:	and, uh, the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay
A:	we've got this amount of money,
A:	let's put into this plan, this plan,
A:	you got Four Oh One K plans.
A:	You have, uh, better vacation plans, uh,
A:	you have, just in general, maternity leave plans that kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations, uh, you know,
A:	they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it.
A:	So, I've worked for both big and small
A:	so I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, uh, the pros and cons of both.
B:	Right.
B:	Well I've worked for, uh, well I worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the only,
B:	they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because they, you know, they're fairly, even though they're a large scale company, they're very, the offices, the individual offices are very small
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and now I work for the Framingham school system because I'm a teacher.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	And, uh, we have much better benefits, you know, in the system.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have a good pension plan.
B:	Uh, let me see, we have a profit sharing plan to a degree.
A:	That's pretty good for, you know, being a, a school district type program.
B:	Right.
B:	And we have the eye glasses, the health care  and the whole kit and caboodle because what  they did is they threw all the town employees in together.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wow.
A:	That's extremely good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Really.
A:	there's no type of, uh, savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for.
A:	There's really,
A:	I think you're allowed so many times, uh, I think two or three days a a year.
A:	It's not accumulative, type of sick leave uh, you know, things like that.
B:	Oh!
A:	So I've been looking at big corporations and saying, the big corporation that I've worked for in the past had the pension plans, had the big health, health care, uh,
A:	you had your insurance
A:	and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a, a very small place.
A:	Uh, they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations.
A:	And
B:	Right.
B:	The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problems, especially the retired ones.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My father's retired from the town of Framingham
A:	Sure.
B:	and he said that they haven't gotten a, a cost of living raise  in over   five years.
A:	No.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired
B:	and  but I hear that bill is in the Senate right now
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's, hopefully  will go through.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, uh, you know, I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They took in the whole town plus all you know,
A:	Is it a union?
B:	Uh, we have the teachers union which helps out a lot,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the town of Framingham pays the benefits
B:	and that's all the town workers, water and sewer
A:	Oh, that's pretty good.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and where it's a very large town,
B:	it's actually, should be a city
B:	but they kept it a town.
A:	Sure.
B:	Uh, where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more which was  really great because we don't have to pay a mayor
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know what you mean
A:	and that's true.
A:	I mean, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position, sure.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	because of most of our, you know, the town employees, as far as, uh, electoral positions, are part-time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it works out good because we  reap the benefits of it
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, but as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary.
A:	Well, that's it, you know,
A:	and, and I've kind of looked around, uh, at that, uh, too.
A:	Because, uh, salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large,
A:	I'm talking like hugh companies like Three M, uh, I'm, uh, Honeywell, uh, Texas Instruments
B:	Right
A:	I know people that are, that have vacation times, and benefits that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation.
A:	You bring it up to the owner
A:	and it's like come on, you know.
A:	Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer.
B:	Right
A:	And, and, of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand
A:	so that money is spent
A:	I don't know if you feel the same
A:	but, uh, when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, uh, two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, you know, you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen
A:	or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a social, uh, sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and  to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.
B:	Um. Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to, uh, mandatory.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Yeah.
B:	A,
B:	yeah,
B:	I kind of agree with that.
B:	Uh, I don't think,
B:	you know, it, they should have, they should have the same rights as anyone else you know.
A:	Right.
A:	Right
B:	It shouldn't be, uh, anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess, like, uh, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.
B:	Uh, or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh, people be more eager to do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And doing it for a purpose that they want.
A:	The other thing is this,
A:	I have thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems
A:	but there are other people out in the community that may have problems.
A:	Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.
A:	You have to do so much as far as in  community service now.
B:	Right.
A:	If they were, you know, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the community to beautify it or whatever
A:	but I could see that working in you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's, I think they have done that
A:	and judges have said well, you know, this is what you're going to get for a, you know, a misdemeanor or something,
A:	you may end up having to do some kind of community service
A:	so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,
A:	so
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that's a good idea.
B:	Uh, I think they should have more programs like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail or in trouble anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	We sure do.
B:	So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And  I, I agree wholeheartedly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.
B:	And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would rehabilitate   rehabilitate  rehabilitate them
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then when they get out, they,
B:	because they have this stigmatism of being in jail.
A:	And there's a lot of anger, sure. You know, especially if they haven't went through treatment
A:	and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever.
A:	I would say the crimes would probably be, you know,
A:	if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have,
A:	so you're dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on
A:	and, uh, an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two
A:	but I didn't get any rehabilitation
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or, uh, you know. But then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, uh, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in  the community if they're of a violent sort and to say
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, I don't know about you,
A:	but, uh, I work outside the home
A:	and, uh, in fact, uh, I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work
A:	and I work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I don't have I don't have the family time.
A:	Uh, when my husband gets home, it's usually, he's home with my daughter alone
A:	and then a couple of hours later I'm home.
A:	Uh, I don't know,
A:	I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to, there's less and less family time available to them.
A:	And, uh, it seems that business wise, uh, in the business community, or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family.
A:	So, you know, if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done, uh, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children,
A:	and it, it's sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.
B:	I agree
A:	And, you know, I look at my daughter
A:	and she's now, uh, four, going to be four
A:	and I keep saying oh jeez, I don't have that much time with her
B:	Yeah.
A:	And she's growing fast
A:	and,
B:	I know that I have three children.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I stay home.
B:	I don't work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I know that it, it must be really challenging to, uh, try to juggle a job and, and also your children.
B:	Because I know my husband, if I were gone as much as he is we wouldn't have the influence on them that I would want to put on them.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah
A:	Sure.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And I also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don't like to be around adults.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They don't want to play around adults.
B:	They don't want to be around you.
B:	They don't want you to tell them what to do.
B:	They want to do their own thing.
A:	Sure.
B:	And they're the very same age as my children.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And I'm finding as I volunteer up at the school, I just, being, uh,
B:	I'm not educated at all in, uh, really detecting this
B:	but I can talk to the teacher and tell them, on a pretty good basis, after I've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
B:	And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that, uh, the ones that are, are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Not that the kids that go out aren't getting that
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	it's just a different,
B:	they're, they are more use to being with their own age kids
A:	Sure.
B:	they're not use to being with adults and to responding  to adults.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I ,
B:	Uh, I think the trend in the United States,
B:	I feel really bad that it's turned so much  to where the children are, uh,
A:	I think so too.
A:	In fact, uh, I spent the first three years at home with my daughter,
A:	so I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that.
A:	And I did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare
A:	and I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks,
A:	whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.
A:	But how these women must feel to place their children into care
A:	and, you know, it's our society saying yes,
A:	this, uh, you need this job.
A:	It's a little bit financial type thing
A:	because, uh, if you look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, uh, their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are
A:	and  that's part of it too.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.
A:	Got a part-time job
A:	and then financially, they got themselves into well, I'll have the boat,
A:	I'll have the car
A:	and  it's nice
B:	Right.
A:	and really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too, uh,
A:	because it is now, our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now
A:	and,
B:	It's hard.
B:	It really is hard.
B:	I know that my husband and I have to do a lot of sacrificing  to keep me home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure,
A:	I did it  for three years
B:	And, uh,
A:	and, uh, it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
A:	and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home
A:	and you're not getting any further, you know, along
B:	Right.
A:	and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time
A:	and you have to make that decision
A:	and it's a tough one.
B:	Right.
B:	I think  one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, how they spend their time with their children
A:	And I,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think with working moms, if you can get them the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work,
A:	Sure.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	So, what do you think about it?
A:	Should,
B:	Um, I like the idea of nursing homes as a, as a growing the choices you have in nursing homes now, whereas used to, you used to have only, you put, you know,
B:	when, when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there was no other choice.
B:	You couldn't take them in your own home,
B:	then they went into a nursing home.
B:	You know, maybe you lived too far away to care for them,
A:	Right.
B:	or your daily job or whatever prevented it.
B:	But, um, I like the choices you have now, where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some, basically have a independent life-style, but assisted care.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, you know, like, where they prepare their meals for them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and they still live somewhat independently
B:	but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, you know, where some people can't, where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they can't get around
B:	but then they have full care.
B:	But I really like those, those options now,
B:	and, and I think about it more often because my husband's parents are, they're very active right now,
B:	but they're seventy-five and, and seventy-two.
B:	So, that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things because of their age.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
A:	Um, it's, it's funny
A:	because, um, I know people at, that are in all three, and people that work, you know,
A:	I know someone that works in all three different stages like you said.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I have known, you know, people close to me that have been in all three,
A:	and I have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building,
A:	they, we call it, um,
A:	well, we have high rises,
A:	and it's just for elderly people, you know,
A:	or most of, most of, one of their spouses has already passed away.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, it's, it's really nice to go and see them, you know, where they can still get around and everything,
A:	and they still, you know, do their own thing,
A:	but it's, it's really nice to see them because,
A:	I mean sometimes,
A:	like I had a great aunt,
A:	she lived with us for, um, three months, and, because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease.
A:	And I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters,
A:	and I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to, to actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing.
B:	Right.
A:	And to actually sit,
A:	so it's really nice to see that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's some of the things I would find important before I, I would look into that for a person, is, is, is like you're saying, a good mix of people who have the same interests.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and the programs,
B:	here they have different, uh, besides just different levels within the same program, they have different types of programs.
B:	They have several areas.
B:	They have one area in town where the people,
B:	I guess a lot of it comes with money.
B:	I, this, this one area is a bit more expensive,
B:	and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life.
B:	But, but things that people where they have similar interests.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like you're saying,
B:	and the programs that they have, where, where some of them will have dances once a week
A:	Yeah.
B:	and some of them sponsor different crafts,
B:	and they go to the arboretum to see things,
B:	and they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a bus there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, it'll, or, you know, or someone will transport them to a specific church, even though it's, you know, maybe it's thirty minutes away,
B:	because it's a big, you know, Dallas area is a big metropolitan area.
A:	Yeah
B:	But a lot of these places have, have churches or have, have individual transportation.
B:	That's, that's something I'd look for, something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because I don't think a lot of people really, even in the nice ones, and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, um, enjoyable for them. That'd, that'd be one thing I'd look for, along with the, uh, health care aspects to make sure they had, you know, that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I'm in college,
A:	and I'm, I'm only twenty-one
A:	but we had a I had a speech class last semester,
A:	and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I was so surprised to hear how many people,
A:	like whenever they're in, you know, the older people, they're like, um, fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they, you know, they wander the halls. And they get the wrong medicine, just because, you know, the, the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so many of them, you know, are,
B:	Are overmedicated, too.
A:	Yes.
A:	And it was, it was awful to hear what, you know, what some of these people really went through.
A:	And I forget the percentage of people that, you know, that she had said,
A:	and this was, I mean, she did research on it and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's one of the things that, that we don't think about as we get older, and the, the money that it now requires to, uh, be in one of these places.
B:	Because some of these people that are just on social security,
B:	and if they don't have any living relatives,
B:	perhaps they never had children
B:	or if their children, you know, passed away before they did they can be in some places that are, you know, that, that are not good.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Or they, they have very minimum, minimal care
B:	and the, the care that they are getting, the people who are giving it are are paid at a minimum wage,
B:	and they just they don't care as much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and like you said, they're trying to make it, the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That certainly would be something to, to watch for.
B:	Because you've got, with some of them being, some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in, .
A:	I know,
A:	and and sometimes they share a room,
A:	and it's just a little cubbyhole,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they share it with another person,
A:	and they're still paying that much.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	so you've,
A:	It, it, it just sometimes, it just seems ridiculous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care, what kind of level of care you need, and then what you can, unfortunately what you can afford at the same time.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Um, I've been lucky,
A:	well, my mom's, um, parents, they're both in their, in their, uh, eighties,
A:	and I was just home for spring break
A:	and my grandma said something to me about, she goes, well maybe we'll just sell the house.
A:	She said, it's getting too big for us to take care of.
A:	And I was like, no,
A:	no,
A:	no,
A:	stay in the house as long as you can.
B:	Well, like there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a nursing home.
B:	I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that, um, was in a,
B:	it was a, it was a housing division.
B:	Each person had their own little bitty house that they had built,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it was, um, supplemented,
B:	their, they were, most of them were on social security,
B:	and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government.
B:	But it was this little bitty one bedroom house,
B:	but it was a separate house,
B:	and they had a living room, and a bedroom and a kitchen, and a bathroom.
A:	Oh.
B:	So they still had, they had, and they had people who came in who, um, supervised, all these houses,
B:	were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they had a, a supervisory, um,
B:	wasn't a house, really,
B:	it was, it was more like, um, a headquarters or something, anyway, where they, they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone, if they needed someone, they could ring
A:	It sounds like, uh, an apartment or
B:	and, and someone, could come to their house.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that, and they always cooked,
B:	then they had, they had the choice, you know,
B:	they lived in their own little house.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They had their own possessions still in there, to some you know, some of them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to, and their own dinner,
B:	and they always had somebody come in for lunch.
B:	But they had people who did, you know, they didn't have to mess with the yard.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They had people who did the yard,
B:	and they had a maid that, uh, uh, service that came in and cleaned everybody's house.
B:	So they didn't have to worry about that.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And it was really a nice, it was really a nice compromise, especially, because she felt like she was still living in her own house.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she still had her own couch, and her own bed,
B:	and it, it really helped a lot,
B:	and she was a lot more comfortable,
B:	and she didn't resent like having to be in a situation, because she still had a lot of her own possessions.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	See, now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were,
A:	well, I've lived here for thirty years,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we've built this, and this is our home,
A:	and we have nothing else to show for our lives,
A:	and we don't want to leave.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh, we've run into a lot of that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it would be hard to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's, that's why this,
B:	she was, she felt that way, too,
B:	but when, it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I guess that, that,
B:	it was a pilot program I think, where she lived,
B:	so it's probably not widely available.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's what like,
A:	well, um, now I know we have an
A:	we call it an old folks home,
A:	but it's basically a nursing home too,
A:	but everyone has basically their own room.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they're you know,
A:	none of them have cars because they can't drive.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But if someone would come to get them, you know, they're allowed to leave with them,
A:	and there's a staff there that makes supper for them,
A:	and each person has a chore,
A:	like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables.
B:	Uh.
A:	And it's really nice because that keeps them going, too, rather than just sitting around.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I know, um, our youth group goes over
A:	and we play bingo with them and, you know, like, stuff like that.
B:	That's good.
B:	Everybody needs some sense of responsibility.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	An even, even if it's just a little bit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	just to keep them going.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's, it's more like living with a big, in a big house where it's your turn to, to set the table, like you're saying, or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that would be nice.
A:	But I think before
A:	like you,
A:	I don't think I don't think it's right to just put someone in it.
A:	I think they would have to agree to go in it.
B:	Yes,
B:	unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapacitated
A:	Well, yeah.
B:	Like you're saying with Alzheimer's and stuff, they're going to be some people who have to be there whether they want to or not,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it, when you're, when you're in something like that, that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without, or they need, without overdoing it. Without doing something to make this, you know, to keep, like you're saying, to keep them still to make the staff happy.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed.
B:	Um, but anyway, so, so as far as,
B:	we really, we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of T V because we both were raised, you know, that way, you know, where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we just don't want that.
B:	We want more communication and interaction, you know, amongst us as a family.
B:	And we both like sports,
B:	so we figured, well what, what better way to get out and, you know, be together as a family and also, you know, have it be good for you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And plus, we like, we both like to cook,
B:	so, you know, that's something we spend time together too, is, you know, cooking and, uh, preparing meals and stuff.
B:	So, uh, but as far as that that's about all we've discussed as far as for family.
A:	Really,
A:	okay,
A:	well see, I'm the third oldest of twelve children.
B:	Oh my gosh.
A:	So like I said, I,
A:	and I'm only twenty-one.
A:	I'll be twenty-two next month.
A:	So there's nine that are younger than me.
A:	My youngest sister is five.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	And like I I don't have any children.
A:	I'm just engaged,
A:	and I'm getting married in October,
A:	and we haven't discussed this at all Um.
B:	Yeah,
B:	long way down the road, right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
A:	But, um, now I've noticed that like, while I'm at college, and when I go home, my you know, my,
A:	I'm really close to the younger ones,
A:	and, um, like, when, when, like when I do go home they enjoy just laying around me, you know,
A:	like if we do watch T V at night, they just like enjoy just, like laying on top of me or something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They like that.
A:	But, um, as far as that goes, like we play games,
A:	I play like Old Maid and Fish with them,
A:	and we play board games,
A:	and when it's
A:	like I'm from Pennsylvania,
A:	so when it's nice out, we go outside,
A:	and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And in the summer everyone is like, I think there's like seven of us still at home,
A:	and all seven are in a sport,
A:	like also the girls are in softball
A:	and the boys are in baseball.
A:	So all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports,
A:	that's it, you know.
B:	Well do you, do you,
B:	so you go, if you're, if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers' sporting events. And sort of like be there with them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
A:	we go and watch.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's, that's good, too, I mean, as far as entering,
B:	I mean, you're, you're participating,
B:	but you're not, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
B:	and that's,
A:	Yeah.
B:	because, um, even if our kids, you know, get into sports that we're really not interested in, I don't, I want them, you know, to know that we're still there so to speak, as a family.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it's funny because, um, well, my mom and dad both were kind of athletic.
A:	They both grew up on a farm,
A:	but although, you know, it wasn't them playing I notice like whenever I was playing softball and such, my mom and dad got into it more than I did.
A:	I mean, they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling, you know,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Cheering you on and stuff.
A:	A lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids,
A:	and I found, like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff, it was really funny because the crowds would like get into you know, get into fights, who can scream louder, and you know, everything.
A:	So it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it,
A:	and they're not really even participating.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that, that would be fun.
B:	Boy, so you, you have a lot of experience as far as, you know, different ways a family can interact and, and do things together, as far as,
A:	Yeah.
B:	twelve.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's
B:	so, if you're not,
B:	what if,
B:	do people go off in their own little groups with that many?
B:	I mean, did like some people go to their rooms and ,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, um,
A:	the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, like I say, you know, I'm twenty, I'll be twenty-two next month,
A:	and I'm closer to the younger kids than I am the ones my own age.
A:	And that's, I think, that's because the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do,
B:	Huh.
A:	and the younger kids are at home,
A:	and I like to spend time with them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But when you were growing up and they weren't, and the younger ones weren't around, what did you do?
A:	We were all pretty close when we were younger.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	But now that they've all sort of moved off,
A:	Yeah,
A:	now that we're getting older, people are you know, each one of us are going our own direction.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, do you think, even,
B:	I mean, what did you do when you were younger,
B:	did you go do the board games and stuff,
B:	you still did what you do now.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, um, we, you know, we had blocks and stuff,
A:	and we just did, we would make,
A:	like in the winter when it
A:	we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we, uh, we would, um, clear out our basement,
A:	and we would like, do, just, even stupid things,
A:	like we try hurtling our couches and stuff. You know, and.
B:	Hurling.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we would just run and jump over the couches.
B:	Oh, hurtle,
B:	oh, okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	to see who could jump over, you know.
A:	We just made up our own stupid little games.
A:	And like hide and seek,
A:	well, we have a, a bigger house than a lot, you know,
A:	our house isn't the average small one.
A:	So we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that.
B:	So you, you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well see, they're, um, we're all, like we're all pretty close together.
A:	Like, my sister that's closest to me, we're only fourteen months apart.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So there was always, there was never just one alone, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no, not real spread in age.
A:	Right.
A:	So we were all pretty close where we, we always had a buddy to play with, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Gosh, twelve,
B:	is that, is that pretty common up there, uh, in,
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	not at all.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Not at all
B:	I don't meet, I mean, I don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more.
B:	I mean my, my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I mean, that's his mother you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and their Catholic *they're
B:	and, I mean that's,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I'm Catholic
B:	Well that's it then, I think,
B:	probably maybe that, that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I mean, do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids?
A:	No,
A:	not at all.
A:	Not at all.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, see, um, when I was younger I used to say that I would like to have five.
A:	Well, I've even cut that down now,
A:	and, um, but to me five wasn't even a lot, because I was just so used to twelve.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
B:	But it's so expensive, man.
A:	But, yeah,
A:	it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children.
B:	I would think for your parents it would be, it would still be hard even nowadays, I mean, just to raise twelve kids.
A:	Well, Well, okay, well like my oldest brother, he's, he's twenty-four,
B:	Would be, shoosh.
A:	and he put himself through college,
A:	and, um, there's a sister older than me,
A:	she's still living at home,
A:	but she works you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I think she even gives mom and dad a little bit, you know, of rent money.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm putting myself through college,
A:	and like I'm getting married in October,
A:	and my fianc3e and I are paying for most of the wedding.
A:	And then, then my brother right behind me, he moved out,
A:	and he has an apartment,
A:	and he works,
A:	and then the next one down is in the Marines,
A:	and he's out of the house.
A:	So, it's kind of like they don't, you know.
B:	Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know.
B:	I mean you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody
A:	I, I think they do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself, if you really want it.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Like, uh, well, I find it a lot when I'm up here at college because I've always had a bank account,
A:	I've always had my own checking account since I was in like tenth grade.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, I would work in the summer,
A:	and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or, you know, to, to manage money.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like my roommate's laughing at, you know, at me, you know, because their schooling's paid for.
B:	Or manage money or know,
B:	yeah,
B:	know, you know, how to get, how to even go about getting money.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, how to get a job or you know, just what, you know, what, when you get a job, what your responsibility is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Are you going to blow all that money,
B:	how easy it is to blow money you earn.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And see, and then, my mom and dad, like whenever, like we would go out and we would get a summer job,
A:	and then we would start blowing money,
A:	and my mom said, well that's stupid for you to be blowing money.
A:	She goes, okay if your going to blow your money on other things, she goes, you can just pay for your life insurance.
A:	So then we, when we all graduated from college, from high school, we all got,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we're still, like I'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because I'm still in school,
A:	but I have my own policy, too.
A:	So I had a
A:	you know, my mom and dad got it set up, you know, you know, helped me to get it and everything,
A:	and I have my own policy,
A:	and then I pay for my own life insurance too.
B:	Wow, you've really got responsibilities.
A:	And then And then, like, my mom and dad, because there's so many of us, and because of the way the laws are, you know, now, if we want to drive, we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because my mom said, that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it,
A:	if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now.
A:	And she said that's really not fair to the younger kids.
A:	If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued
A:	and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad,
A:	and the little kids would have nothing.
A:	And I, I agree with her.
A:	You know, I just, I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So if, you know, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,
A:	and.
B:	So really, I think, sometimes there's an advantage,
B:	I mean, sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it, so to speak you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, um, I don't know,
B:	sometimes,
B:	but now, it, it is hard, I can imagine, on your parents, you know ...
A:	Okay,
A:	so you watch DAVID LETTERMAN?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, see our favorite T V show,
A:	I, I, I live in a dorm
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and our favorite T V show is CHEERS.
B:	Oh, really,
B:	yeah
B:	that's pretty awesome, too.
B:	I watch it every now and then.
A:	Okay,
B:	That's hilarious.
A:	well, we try,
A:	like here they show it, like, every day.
B:	Oh, serious
A:	And then, like, on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on.
B:	Oh, that's cool.
A:	But we watch it like every day.
A:	But I, like, late night, we don't watch, uh,
A:	what we do is, we stay up till around one thirty,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they show the TWILIGHT ZONE at one thirty,
A:	and so we just stay and watch that.
B:	TWILIGHT ZONE rules, man.
A:	The what?
B:	TWILIGHT ZONE rules.
A:	Yeah,
B:	That's all.
A:	I used, I used to live in the house that the guy owned.
B:	Are you serious?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was really, it was really, oh, well, it was all full with, uh, shelves everywhere
A:	and we didn't have enough books to fill it up
A:	but, But, uh, so what, what do you like, why do you like DAVID LETTERMAN?
B:	That's psychedelic.
B:	Oh, he just, like, totally sarcastic and hilarious
B:	and, I don't know,
B:	I'm a lot like him in a way,
B:	so and he's got curly hair
A:	So the,
B:	and so do I
B:	so,
A:	Oh, do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE?
A:	What?
A:	He's got what?
B:	Curly hair
B:	and so do I,
B:	so hey
A:	Hey I got long hair,
A:	wait,
A:	wait
B:	Cool,
B:	how long is it?
A:	Uh, I don't know,
A:	but people,
A:	the other day I went into a bar
A:	and this guy asked me to dance.
A:	All he saw was my hair
A:	and he goes, do you want to dance.
A:	I turn around and go, what!
A:	He goes do you want to dance.
A:	I go no,
A:	no,
A:	he goes oh, oh, I'm sorry.
A:	I go, yeah,
A:	you better be.
A:	I go, you better be
B:	That's hilarious.
A:	so, But, okay, so wait
A:	do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE yesterday?
B:	No,
B:	it,
B:	with the, uh,
B:	who was on, the music people,
B:	wasn't that Fishbone.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
B:	I saw that,
B:	it was awesome.
B:	But I didn't see the rest of it.
A:	No,
A:	oh, you missed WAYNE'S WORLD.
B:	Are you serious?
A:	WAYNE'S WORLD was pretty cool.
B:	They're awesome.
A:	So, uh, let's see,
A:	what else.
A:	Uh, see, like, all we do here is, like, every time we walk in the room we turn on the T V because we don't want to do anything like study or anything,
B:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that sucks.
A:	so all the, all we do is turn,
A:	like, like, when I was in high school I used to do, like, my homework in front of the T V set, you know.
B:	Really?
B:	Uh, kind of annoying
B:	but that's cool.
A:	What?
B:	Kind of annoying to, like, in front of T V, like trying to do homework, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Trying to write an essay, you start talking about, you know, like, IN LIVING COLOR or something,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, I like, I, I just, I just bogused on all my homework
A:	so it really didn't matter
B:	Cool,
B:	yeah,
B:	B S
B:	that's the way to do it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know,
A:	and I did that all through college
A:	and it worked
B:	Cool,
B:	yeah,
B:	works for me.
A:	So, uh, let's see,
A:	what else.
A:	Like, the news we don't watch, because they're boring.
B:	No,
B:	unless,
B:	I watched through the war, you know,
B:	there's only one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	especially the war,
A:	I mean it was like, I, haven't I seen this episode before, you know.
B:	I know,
B:	I guess they think that people don't watch T V,
B:	but I mean if you watch it for, like, five minutes, then it repeats everything over and over and over.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	It's, like, oh, man.
A:	And, and in North
A:	see the, the thing is, like here they just, they just give you like local news, okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like, a house burned down in this little town.
B:	Oh.
A:	And were here,
A:	and I go, so what happened worldwide, you know.
A:	It's like, you know, even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else, they're not going to tell you, you know,
A:	they're going to spend more time on doing a, a thing on a, on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old, than they are on anything else, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, but, uh, let's see,
A:	what else.
A:	Oh, we watch, like for example, uh,
A:	okay,
A:	do you watch STAR TREK?
B:	Uh, I haven't seen it in years,
B:	but I used to.
A:	Okay,
A:	well I used to hate STAR TREK.
B:	Yeah?
A:	I thought, I thought,
A:	like, when it, like, when I was, like, in high school and junior high school, I used to hate it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but then we started watching it.
A:	And, and, like, the new ones are pretty cool because, because they got like, uh, like special, like especially things, that, like, fuck with your mind.
B:	Really?
B:	Oh, really,
B:	that's cool.
A:	Because what happened is, like they have this hologram right, where you walk in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you can program
A:	and everything looks real
A:	and you can touch everything and stuff.
B:	Are you serious?
B:	Oh, man.
A:	But it's only a program
A:	and it's really great because sometimes it's like the hologram makes up all these things
A:	and, uh, I mean sometimes it, sometimes it's funny,
A:	sometimes it's not,
A:	but, uh, you know, it's something to pass the time, till we do
B:	That's cool.
B:	Sound like .
A:	and then, and then we watch football.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	basketball's cool,
B:	but football kind of after a while,
A:	Which basketball?
B:	Which basketball?
A:	College or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I kind of like college better,
B:	it's more spirited .
A:	We got, we got two teams of the A C C going there.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	We got Duke and North Carolina.
B:	Cool.
A:	But, I mean the, I mean there's nothing to do,
A:	like for example yesterday uh, they go, some girl goes, do you dares want to go to a picnic, right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I hear no, *looks mistranscribed
A:	we're just, you know, it's like we just woke up,
A:	we had a hangover and everything, you know.
A:	And so we just woke up
A:	and, uh, we're watching T V,
A:	and I go, no,
A:	today we're just going to dedicate ourself to watching golf and bowling, you know,
B:	golf,
B:	yay.
A:	and everybody, it was, like, oh, God, do you guys really watch that?
A:	No,
A:	you know, I was,
A:	like, a whole golf tournament, it's,
A:	like, for example, baseball,
A:	I hate baseball,
A:	I mean, Somebody told me, like, that, like, you can watch baseball,
B:	Oh, me, too.
A:	and the actual play time that there is is five minutes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because by, the play time is when the person, when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the, when the pitcher pitches and it's hit.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
B:	That's true.
A:	and that's, like, you know, five seconds for the whole play
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	and that's it.
A:	I mean, maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases, you know.
A:	But I mean, it's, it's like that,
A:	I mean it's was, it's just,
A:	but when I went home that's all, like, they had on T V
B:	Ooh, really?
A:	so I I watched entire games of baseball
A:	and they're going oh, my God.
A:	And T V in Argentina's really bad.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	So, so why from Argentina, why'd you come over here?
A:	Uh, because, uh, I wanted to go to school here.
B:	Oh, that's cool.
A:	Yeah,
B:	How long did you live there?
A:	they have better computer science up here than they, than they do down there.
B:	Oh
A:	So, and I also, uh, my father works for I B M,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we came up here,
A:	we, well, we came to the United States in nineteen seventy-six, seventy-seven and, uh, we lived here for about seven years
B:	Uh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	then we moved back.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And I, I don't know,
B:	probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas.
A:	Is it?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I think so.
A:	Especially with, uh, uh,
A:	when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,
B:	Right.
A:	especially in East Texas, it's really nice.
A:	So, uh, well, I, um, I have enjoyed talking with you.
B:	It was nice talking to you.
A:	And, um, have, uh, some happy camping trips
A:	Hope you get to those places you have talked about.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you too.
A:	Well, okay,
A:	thanks.
B:	Bye,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, well, right now we have one dog inside.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She goes out
A:	but I mean she's an indoor dog.
B:	Yes.
A:	And two outside cats.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Male and female.
B:	And how long have you had them?
A:	The
A:	the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.
A:	And the cats are, they might be as old.
A:	I'm not sure
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's interesting because we have a
B:	we don't have cats
B:	but we do have a dog, who is an indoor dog,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she is going to be thirteen this summer
B:	so,
A:	Oh, is that right?
A:	What kind of dog do you have?
B:	Um, she's, um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.
A:	Oh, that's what ours is
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yes.
B:	Isn't that interesting
B:	What color is your dog?
A:	White.
B:	Oh, well, ours is black,
B:	so
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	definitely different
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	Yes,
B:	she's a female
B:	and she's, um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me.
B:	Um, she's like a little shadow, you know, kind of, follows me around all the time,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.
B:	She doesn't hear very well
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	she doesn't see very well
B:	but she's,
A:	Well, that's to be expected at, their age.
B:	Yeah,
B:	at this age, I guess so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, she's been a good dog to have,
B:	and I don't know,
B:	once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not
A:	Well, everybody always says no more
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But I, I think animals are really important in the family.
A:	I,
B:	I agree,
B:	yes.
B:	Um, did you get yours as a pet for your
B:	do you have children?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	we, have five.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before
B:	or,
A:	Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.
A:	She was fifteen when she died.
B:	My goodness.
A:	And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,
B:	Uh.
A:	a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that, somebody,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	people drop things like that off, up there,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog."
A:	I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Go get her.
A:	So that's how we got her, quite by accident.
B:	Isn't that,
B:	Yes.
B:	So that often happens that way.
B:	Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.
B:	We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went, then we went out then, and found one,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	she was in the litter,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.
B:	I mean, they were all over the place,
B:	and she was real docile and, came over and just kind of sat next to us,
A:	Oh.
B:	and I thought, that's the dog for me
A:	Oh.
A:	She picked us
B:	Yeah,
B:	so she,
B:	and it,
B:	what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been,
B:	let's see,
B:	she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, she just loved this little dog, to pieces
A:	Oh.
B:	but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.
B:	I think, she was always a little bit leery of her.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,
B:	but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.
A:	Oh, for heaven's sake.
B:	So you just never know how that works out
A:	No.
A:	But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yes.
A:	they want to and tell them anything they want to
A:	and, nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's right.
A:	or
B:	That,
B:	yes,
B:	they're very, unjudgmental
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes
B:	Oh, dear
A:	And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.
B:	Yes,
B:	I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and how,
A:	Our one, our one nursing home in has one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Permanent
B:	Is that right?
A:	He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is or somebody takes care of him.
B:	Isn't that amazing?
A:	But he goes out people,
A:	and real nice dog, uh,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yes.
B:	It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis
B:	and, um, there were several dogs on the campus
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and, the,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,
B:	but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.
B:	And, um, I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.
A:	Oh.
B:	They were healthy, looking dogs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, our guide that day said that the , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus. Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard
A:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah
A:	because most campuses don't allow pets, you know,
B:	I know.
A:	they just do not allow them.
B:	Yes,
B:	I know.
A:	That's, that's kind of great.
B:	Yes,
B:	it really was.
B:	It was just a nice touch,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it kind of made it seem more homey too
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, um,
B:	I thought that was most unique.
B:	And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying, about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, um, but, uh, I,
B:	this is the only pet we've had you know,
A:	Um.
B:	in all our years of marriage, um,
B:	and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs
B:	but they were always hunting dogs,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they were always kind of,
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've ruined them
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	That's what he said.
A:	They say ruined them
B:	Yes.
B:	So having a pet was a little bit different for him.
A:	Well, we've had a lot of different pets.
A:	We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we also raised them for food, at one time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet. For more years than I want to think about
B:	Oh, my golly.
A:	She was in the house
B:	Oh, gosh.
B:	Isn't that interesting?
B:	I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.
A:	Well, don't ever get one for a pet.
B:	Oh.
A:	They're okay,
A:	but like she, uh,
A:	they don't ever learn their name.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you had to go chase her down.
B:	I'll be darned.
B:	How interesting.
A:	And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.
A:	But,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.
A:	They,
A:	before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they're not
A:	I mean, they use the litter box.
A:	That's about it .
B:	Isn't that interesting?
B:	That's, that's really something.
B:	Um, how long did you have that?
A:	Oh, my, how, how long?
A:	Probably seven or eight years.
B:	Goodness sake.
A:	And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,"
A:	so, we moved her to the basement,
A:	and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, built her a pen outside
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	Isn't that funny?
A:	And I thought, I put up with that all those years
B:	Yes,
B:	and this is what it took finally
A:	And, we've had, we've had cats, stay in the house. Different times.
B:	That is,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, one of them ran off.
A:	She ran off once,
A:	or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,
A:	and the second time he never came back.
B:	My goodness.
A:	And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	he kind of moved into a woods down there.
B:	I'll be.
A:	And he got huge down there.
B:	My goodness.
A:	He really grew
A:	but he, he never came back.
B:	That's That's interesting.
B:	I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.
A:	Well, he wasn't a whole lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He was in the house most the time,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, he did go out sometimes
A:	and, uh, they
A:	it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah.
A:	The, the cats,
A:	my son has a cat,
A:	and the vet had told us they get strange, if they're kept in the house all the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And their cat was not a friendly cat,
A:	it was, it was not a good,
B:	Well.
A:	I don't know,
A:	it got,
A:	it was just, did get strange
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that that was right.
A:	And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it has improved the personality.
A:	Americans like me
A:	and whether I night, uh, uh, not,
A:	I think that we're paying too much taxes. Um, that, including taxes in general or income tax,
A:	and, um, the other thing was do we get what we pay for,
A:	I mean, what, what is our, what is our opinion on that
A:	so are you prepared to talk?
B:	Okay.
B:	Oh, I guess so,
B:	go by ear,
A:	Let me push.
B:	Okay,
A:	Let me push one here
A:	Okay, um,
A:	well I can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas.
A:	It's most interesting because we're one of the few, if,
A:	I don't know of any other state, um, does not have a, a state income tax
B:	Right,
A:	so we don't have a state income tax,
A:	but we certainly make up for it in other ways here.
A:	Um, for instance, the local, um, sales tax is eight and a quarter percent.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	Isn't that awful
A:	How about you?
A:	What do you have there?
B:	Uh we have a six percent sales tax.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you have state income tax also?
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, it's been,
A:	people here have just, have this, um,
A:	they've been really holding out in the legislature,
A:	and it's starting to show, um, in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded,
A:	and, and I don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to, to, um, totally avoid having an income tax or not.
A:	I think eventually they're going to have to do it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um. Do you think you pay too much there,
A:	or how do you feel about that?
B:	I don't mind my taxes as much as my social security.
A:	Oh, really
B:	Yeah,
A:	interesting,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	um, the taxes,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I can deal with that because I know everyone else is paying in too, I guess you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
B:	But, uh, oh, I don't know, uh,
B:	the one thing that,
B:	we don't have, uh, tax on clothes do you?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, yes
A:	we do have tax on clothes.
B:	That's what I thought.
B:	I know New York also has a sales tax on clothes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I know a lot of kids, like going to college with me, that lived in New York or out of state, and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that,
A:	How interesting.
A:	I guess I didn't realize that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, we don't have tax on groceries, for instance, uh,
B:	No,
B:	well, we don't have it necessarily on food,
B:	but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right
A:	yes,
A:	yes,
A:	I should, I should have, um, delineated,
A:	yet, your absolutely right.
A:	It's the food, the consumable food parts that, you know, we don't have to pay tax on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and you really have to watch your, your, um, bill.
A:	Sometimes I think, um, it's real interesting to look to see how many things that I buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries
A:	And that's when it really starts to add on,
A:	and, um, so, um, that's, that is sort of a help,
A:	but, um, I don't know,
A:	it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of, of tax on uh, any sale, as far as I'm concerned, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that ,
A:	It's real interesting, this last, um, tax season,
A:	I'm a student,
A:	and the last tax season I had a, just a part time job helping out in a tax office.
A:	And the woman that owned the office was saying, she'd had this business for oh, probably seventeen or eighteen years,
A:	and she was saying as the years have gone on, there are fewer and fewer things that people can, uh, take off of their income tax.
B:	Deduct, yeah.
A:	And, you know, if you're not a home owner, or if you haven't sold property, or, uh, have something major like that, it's hardly, you know it's just not much else you can do,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her, because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of, you know, accumulating receipts.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And see,
B:	I take it she was an accountant.
A:	Can't do, oh, really can't do it any more.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	I know,
B:	well, I, I, I also was a student,
B:	I just graduated in May
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, I graduated with a finance degree,
B:	but that was the big joke, the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax.
B:	That was the big joke.
A:	Where did you go to school?
B:	Clarion University.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, you are, you are the same age as my daughter, because she just graduated from college this year too.
A:	I'm a graduate student having gone back after many years.
A:	So.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, nevertheless, I am a student, and poor
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So, it's, uh, um, you know, it's been,
A:	I guess, as far as people like, uh, our family, we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with, Americans with um, college age students, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and, I, there just, I don't know,
A:	I guess as you say, you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	I think they should go back,
B:	I, I realize, you know, that we have, uh, graduated tax brackets,
B:	but I think they should still go back
B:	and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class, I think the burden should be put more on the wealthy.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Absolutely,
A:	yeah.
A:	Because it seems like, they still come out okay um, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	you know, they always have the argument, Well, you know, well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	well I don't care how much they take off of you, you know
A:	I kind of have my doubts
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you're still going to be above, on top,
B:	and I,
B:	you now
A:	That's,
B:	like you said, I've worked in different places,
B:	and the ones that get the most pay do the least work.
A:	Yes.
A:	that the higher they get, the, you know,
A:	at least,
A:	I don't know,
A:	it seems like, um, they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or, um, or something, or just the title, sometimes um,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it, it doesn't seem fair,
A:	and I, I know a lot of people do make money, um, you know, in, in good investments and things like that,
A:	but I think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling, and not a, not a whole lot of work
B:	I agree with you.
B:	I do think it's a lot of luck,
B:	and I don't like that part of the finance, you know whatsoever.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	I don't know,
B:	but like what I was saying about the social security, that's real, you know,
B:	it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then the more I think about it, the more I think, I'm paying in to something that I,
B:	granted, you know, I'm paying for my grandparents
A:	Right.
B:	but I'm never going to see that.
A:	Probably not.
B:	Social Security is going to be gone before I ever get any.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yes,
A:	or what's left is not going to be worth anything you know, in terms of how,  you can actually use it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right
B:	they're going to pay me  fifty dollars a month, right
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	But that's,
A:	well, and,
B:	I'm sorry,
B:	I put in much more than that, you know.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's,
A:	I haven't heard much in recent years, um, about social security,
A:	I mean, for a while there, not too long ago, they were, they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt you know, before very long, because so much was going out for programs that were, it that originally it was never intended to be used for. Or, you know, programs just weren't in existence
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, um, I,
A:	it sort of calmed down.
A:	I haven't heard much lately,
A:	but if you have talked about that in your classes, you know, in the last few years, I'm sure that you have heard,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, um, I don't know,
A:	I guess we complain about taxes,
A:	but, I guess, you know,  you have to be sort of,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	you got to look to what they put, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	you have to appreciate, yeah, what, what you do get for them sometimes
B:	you have decent roads at least
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, um, I guess it's, it's worse, you know,
A:	I'd rather be able to control my money as much as I do with what's left over taxes than to live in, oh, England or, um, some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
A:	and, so, you know, I guess it's all relative,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it's how you look at it too.
A:	That's exactly right.
B:	I like to,
B:	instead of thinking how much, you know, that I'm paying out, I like to just look at it and say oh, well everyone else is doing it too, you know.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah,
A:	and I,
B:	My name's Mary Dell,
B:	and I live in the Dallas, Texas area where there's a lot of pollution
A:	Okay,
A:	and I'm up in Wisconsin
B:	Oh.
A:	uh, my name is Terry
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, in the small town we don't,
A:	but, uh, we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution.
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay,
A:	I'll go ahead and start recording that,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay, um,
A:	just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations
A:	and, um I'm sure there's a lot of pollution.
B:	Oh.
A:	We, uh,
A:	before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were, um, gravel pits and also where they were making tar,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
A:	and it would, uh,
B:	Ooh.
A:	smell the continuous,
A:	you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs,
A:	so and it was like miles away,
B:	Right.
A:	but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that,
A:	but also, um, where we also lived, too, it was very close to a highway,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so got a lot of fumes from, uh, trucks and cars
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture,
A:	I mean, it was on your tables,
B:	Oh, gosh,
A:	you would dust every day,
A:	and it was dirty, um, type of dust,
A:	I mean, it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	for,
A:	I live in a small, um, town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities, about an hour away,
A:	and I may dust once a week,
A:	and that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city
B:	Huh I'd never thought about that being a cause,
A:	so.
B:	I have to dust a lot as well.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it, it comes right on through through the screens,
B:	Yeah.
A:	the only way that you could actually live in the, in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	My goodness.
A:	and so it was quite a dirty city.
A:	Um, if you were well protected by trees, which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises, you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution
A:	and it's just going for miles and miles and miles,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's landing somewhere with the wind,
A:	but,
B:	That's kind of the way Dallas is.
B:	We're so flat and open,
B:	and I live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation, trees
A:	Sure.
B:	it was all cotton fields,
B:	so we don't have that advantage,
A:	Sure.
B:	and ours I think is primarily cars, where we don't carpool like we should an airport.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I work in a building,
B:	I'm nineteen floors up
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I look out toward D F W International,
B:	and there's just an awful brown haze all the time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport.
A:	Oh, sure,
A:	sure,
A:	yeah.
A:	It's,
A:	I mean, our air quality, um, in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in the other areas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, they were always talking about the air quality of today is this, you know, the ozone or whatever,
A:	and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted
B:	Yes.
A:	and many people are too busy getting to work, not thinking about, Okay, I could have carpooled with a friend,
A:	even my husband was, uh, talking to some of the guys at work,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	now he's, uh, fifteen miles away from work,
A:	but he was talking, wouldn't it be nice to carpool,
A:	and the guy says, Well, it's too close,
A:	it wouldn't pay
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, so.
B:	Want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and,
A:	exactly, and so, my husband says, Well, that's fine, you know,
A:	it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and, you know, the gas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, no,
A:	everybody has their preference to drive by themselves
A:	or, if they do, they, they drive with one little buddy, uh,
A:	at least it's with one person
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but most of the time people are saying forget it.
A:	I don't want to carpool,
A:	it's too much of a hassle,
A:	it's too much involvement
B:	But we're paying for it.
A:	but yet,
A:	Yes,
A:	we are,
A:	and I think of my daughter
A:	and I'm sure you think of your children,
A:	and you kind of say to yourself, what kind of future will they have when they think back and say, well, my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and maybe people are trying,
A:	but they have to change attitudes,
B:	And it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	I, I had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago,
B:	and of course there's no industry, very little trash,
B:	they they don't even have that much that they burn, because they consume everything down to the thread,
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
A:	Well, they,
B:	and it amazed me,
B:	I, I just had totally forgotten how ...
A:	Uh, the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And I sell family products.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Do you,
A:	So I, I don't really, I don't really dress up a whole lot.
A:	Do you work outside?
B:	Well, I, I work, uh,
B:	I'm a C P A
B:	and I do contract work.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And so, and I work with another C P A who just started his own practice
A:	Oh.
B:	and I work with him a couple days a week
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So that, that makes it pretty nice.
B:	It's kind of weird because before I used to work, you know, full time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and, uh, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day, just about.
A:	Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and so it's, uh,
B:	some of my suits I haven't put on for quite a while.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's, It's, it's very nice.
A:	It's kind of nice to relax a little bit.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Gosh,
A:	Well, my, my dress up,
A:	I live out in the country also
A:	so what I wear depends on the weather.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
A:	Uh, so I really, I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I mostly dress, I try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes which I try to wear something easy to take off, you know and put on.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And I don't too often take off my coat even, we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say warm weather.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well, I imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year.
B:	Not really?
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here
A:	so I don't know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But for now, But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, uh, cold weather. And that type of thing.
B:	So you all are waiting for that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now, my daughter works all the time,
A:	so she dresses.
A:	I think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job where you work.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, down here it's sunny most of the time. And, uh, usually warm.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, we had a few cool days, uh, this month,
B:	but not anything, I'm sure, compared to what you've had so far.
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	So, I mean people are still wearing shorts
B:	and and, uh, usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so you start you know, breaking out a coat at that time,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few months
A:	Did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full time
A:	or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts.
B:	No.
B:	No,
B:	never wore slacks.
A:	No slacks.
B:	It was, I think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was one of those understood things that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress or,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even if it's all,
B:	Not,
B:	No,
B:	not, not with what I did. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Most people didn't.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sometimes, like the secretaries might
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.
B:	And I really, you know,
B:	there's some nice pantsuits out
B:	and and I wouldn't have minded, you know, wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, uh,
A:	I know my daughter mostly,
A:	I don't think she ever wears slacks to work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if, uh,
B:	You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional.
B:	I guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Look more like a woman, huh
B:	Yeah
B:	That's right
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And it's the men that make the rules
A:	Uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then that way.
B:	But, no,
B:	we usually, you know,
B:	skirt and, skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So it's nice with me working at home because I can wear pants.
A:	Yeah.
B:	No, no one can see me unless I'm, you know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though at home. Because that's, I, I believe,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, I'm not going to put a skirt on just for him
A:	Oh, you don't think you will, huh
A:	Well, you'll be excused because considering everything
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I, I look at homemaking as a job also. Uh, being a homemaker
B:	Right.
A:	and I, I think sometimes we lose sight of that. Uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you do there in Lubbock as far as, uh, recycling is concerned?
B:	Well, you know they actually started
B:	and I assumed it was T I wide, uh,
B:	they, they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, I've you know
B:	either computer paper or different types of paper.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've had some ideas on how I think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose,
B:	but I, I guess I need to put it on paper and turn it in
A:	Oh, yeah. what would be more efficient about it.
B:	Uh.
A:	what,
B:	Well, the way they have, you know, they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module, or down the hall
B:	or  a lot of people aren't going to get up, walk out of their offices and go there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes.
B:	That's just what we called them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they were recycled cardboard.
B:	They were eight and a half by eleven
B:	and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
B:	and when it filled up you called, you know facilities whoever to come pick it up
B:	and they brought you another box.
B:	So not only is it, you know,
B:	I think more people would take advantage of it and use it, uh,
B:	I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to, to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing.
A:	Oh.
A:	I see.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I, uh, was going to say cause I know I have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it you know
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, if  if I have a, if I, I printed up something that I don't need it, just chunk it in the, in the paper.
B:	If.
B:	Right,
B:	but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together
A:	That's true.
B:	and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full, you close the box, it's already bundled, it's already done for you.
A:	Certainly that's a good idea.
B:	So you're saving a lot of time and effort.
B:	I just need to put it on paper and I guess recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it's feasible
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, what else do they do in the Dallas area?
A:	Well, uh, as far as T I is concerned, I'm not sure.
A:	Uh, and I have heard, you know, uh, in residential situations.
A:	I live in a dorm
A:	and I have heard in residential situations, uh, like in Plano uh, that they are doing, uh, stuff like having recycle picked up where, uh, the city, uh, I guess the sanitation department, uh, as part of their responsibility picks up, uh, the recycled items as well, you know, the plastics and the paper uh, and aluminum
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	and, uh, the only responsibility of the, of the, patron is to separate them
A:	and then the, the,
A:	uh, I guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them
A:	and it doesn't cost the patron anything.
A:	Doesn't really cost the, uh, department.
B:	Anything extra.
A:	Right.
A:	They don't pay, they don't pay for the recycled items.
B:	That sounds good.
B:	There's,
B:	I, I've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where, you know, from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other
B:	or the, the even, uh,
B:	there are areas that can recycle the, the tin cans, like your you know, vegetable things come in
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, so I, I've not done that,
B:	but that's kind of what I want to set up so. Because we do go through aluminum cans, you know.
B:	That's probably the one we use most.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but,
A:	Well, what kind of services do you have there in Lubbock as far as,
A:	I, I lived in Abilene for a, uh,
A:	I went to school there at Abilene Christian
A:	and I,
A:	it was so hard to, uh,
A:	you know if you  you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible.
B:	Find a place.
B:	Well, uh, uh they, they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers, aluminum cans, those are the two major items.
B:	You know, we can take oil, like car oil, recycled oil to,
B:	they have, uh, uh, dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town.
A:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I think they can do the plastics, like the liter bottles things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, I, I don't know.
B:	I know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Well, that's good.
B:	I do that
B:	I think people are becoming more aware. You know of, of the waste
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you know I, I like to see, you know,
B:	you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you know, so, you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it.
B:	You know, maybe it's making an impact
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you tend to buy more recycled items that, if something, uh, the pack says recycled and something else doesn't?
A:	Do,
A:	would you tend to chose the one that does
A:	or,
B:	I'm not as good about searching something out like that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but if I am there and the choice is there I would probably take the recycled product.
A:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, you know, that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible, citizen wise, you know, looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way.
A:	Sure,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, uh, you know, they are getting away from the styrofoam,
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, discussing air pollution today, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, uh, well, give me your first impressions.
A:	Uh, I don't know,
A:	there's a lot of air pollution.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I think industries and companies provide a lot of it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, with, uh, I guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff, that would have a lot of air pollution in it.
B:	Uh, puts a whole,
B:	yeah,
B:	gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be,
B:	but, uh, that stuff going on over there.
B:	What, what, uh, what part of Pennsylvania are you in?
A:	Um, I'm north of Pittsburgh,
A:	so.
B:	Okay,
B:	okay,
B:	so, it's, it's amazing too, you know, with that, with the oil wells burning over there, that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day, just in, uh, just in a little different grade, I guess.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, in Dallas, we've got, we've just, uh, brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars, because, uh, people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas.
B:	Everybody loves their car,
B:	and you see an awful lot of, uh, one person vehicles on the road on, during rush hours.
B:	That seems to be our biggest problem down here.
B:	Um, you know, there's, uh, there's a lot of industry around,
B:	but, uh, it's not, it's
B:	any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air.
B:	It's typically water type situation.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um. We have a couple, we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff,
A:	and I know there's a lot of air pollution going in there,
A:	and like they, they get fined whenever they do the air pollution
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but the fine is nothing, you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's,  like, like two hours of output or something like that.
A:	it's like nothing to them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, a, uh, I grew up in South Dakota,
B:	so I was never, I was never exposed to anything of, of the, of the sort.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, there were always E P A people and what not were always telling us that, uh, farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we just, we just never saw the results.
B:	There was, there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not,
B:	but that, that was all we ever saw,
B:	and then five years ago I moved to Dallas,
B:	and I suddenly started to understand what burning eyes, and all that stuff is about that I'd always heard about.
B:	It, uh, it's, it gets, it's real depressing.
B:	In the morning sometime you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by, uh, how far out from downtown, uh, you can be on the road and still not see it.
A:	Oh, my God
B:	And, uh, yeah,
B:	I mean, it's not,
B:	I don't think Dallas is considered, uh, a real bad place for air pollution,
B:	but, you, you can tell, you can tell the differences in the days, when it's, when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a, a foggy, misty color
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it, it's a little, it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	but, I don't know what they can do to really prevent it, you know.
A:	Like, how,
A:	what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait?
A:	What, you know,
A:	I mean they fine the industries,
A:	but you know, that doesn't seem to stop them there
B:	Right.
A:	I don't know what else they can do.
B:	Right.
B:	It, it's that there really isn't a whole lot.
B:	It's one of those, uh, it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and, uh, and, you know, every little bit does help,
B:	I do believe that.
B:	Um, but I also believe that the earth is a kind of a self-regulating system,
B:	and, uh, it will clean itself up, eventually.
B:	It,
B:	the whole idea is not to, not to push the limit too hard, I guess
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	let the, you know, let the natural, natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I,
A:	yeah,
A:	I just don't understand, you know, what else anyone can do about it.
A:	I don't think it's something that people really think about, either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, it's, I mean, it, it should probably be a big issue, you know, because it's, it's doing a lot of damage,
A:	but I,
A:	it's something, you know,
A:	I don't think many people really think about it, because it's nothing they,
A:	I don't think we really have too much control over it.
B:	Right.
B:	And it's one of those things,
B:	it, it's so hard to measure what, what the damage is
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's kind of like, oh,
B:	I guess it's kind of like, kind of like cigarette smoking, you know.
B:	It, it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually, actually say, Yeah, it's, it's, it's doing, doing some damage and something's got to be done.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, there's, you know, there's a lot of things like that.
B:	It,
B:	you can, uh, you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks,
B:	but until it breaks, you don't really know that there, you were doing anything to it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Well, I really don't know too much else about it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that's, that's,
B:	I think we both agree it's, it's one of those deals that, uh,
B:	I just think there's a lot of other problems right now
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we've done a lot to take care of it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	we have tried,
A:	I mean, you know, and, um, I, I know where, you know, where a couple of the mills that have,
A:	I know they put things on their stacks, you know, to filter the smoke, and do all kinds of things,
A:	but, I mean, every now and then it breaks, you know,
A:	and and you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two, until you can get it fixed.
B:	Oh, sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	and so, so, you know, it's something we, we have tried to help.
B:	Oh, there's no doubt about it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know if you ever happened to see some of the like, Twenty Twenty and what not about Rumania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know, they had absolutely no regulations, no controls whatsoever,
B:	and they had destroyed entire forests and what not, just because the air was so polluted.
B:	That's, that's the kind of things that, uh, you don't see in this country,
B:	and that's, that's why I think that, you know, it's,
B:	I don't know if you can ever do enough,
B:	but, uh, I think it's all relative to the, to the time and place,
B:	and I think right now it's, it's pretty much under control.
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay,
A:	well.
B:	All righty.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's been nice talking to you.
B:	Well, you bet.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Well Amy it's been, uh, kind of overcast today and cloudy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We have,
A:	our,
A:	I have a son in kindergarten,
A:	he was having a kite day,
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	and I was really worried about it raining because it has, there's been some dark clouds
A:	and it's been, um, and it's been pretty rainy looking.
B:	Yeah
B:	I've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week
B:	and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within forty-eight hours,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so I keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain, it's going to rain, it's going to rain,
B:	but it really hasn't rained
A:	I know it just has that,
B:	I know.
A:	I,
A:	it looks,
A:	several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not, not done anything.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we have a lot of trees in our yard
A:	and I probably,
A:	they're pretty old, big tall trees,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well, I get tired with the
B:	I have two preschoolers, a three year old and a two year old,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if it's not nice and they can't go out, it's really the pits
A:	Oh, I bet.
B:	But I appreciate it when they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That makes a big difference
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I, uh,
A:	we're kind of new to Plano
A:	and I'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school
A:	and I'm thinking that this has been pretty, you know, rainy season,
A:	and it's been kind of scary,
A:	it's kind of been cloudy every day,
A:	and I thought, well, I'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, my three and half year old, he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know any day,
A:	Well, yeah.
B:	I mean all Winter long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard.
B:	So, I'm hoping, you know, that,
B:	it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to, you know, muggy, and hot,
B:	and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty-five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really miss that,
B:	I'm from Chicago originally,
B:	and I miss the seasons that, you know, that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here.
A:	Well, I know in, um,
A:	I'm from Missouri
A:	and we always had pretty nice four seasons
A:	and, and you know,
A:	we have some extreme weather in each season,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, I like that
A:	and we moved here from Houston in, in, uh, July
A:	and everyone kept saying, oh, you're going up north it's not going to be so hot,
A:	it's not going to be so humid,
B:	Oh
A:	Yeah,
A:	that has just not been the case.
B:	Oh, really
A:	It has been,
B:	yeah.
B:	It's pretty hot here during the Summer gosh.
A:	Oh it was extremely hot,
A:	I thought I was going to die,
A:	my car, I thought it was going die last Summer
A:	but,
B:	Do have air conditioning in your car
B:	or,
A:	Well, the air conditioning was broke,
A:	but broken,
A:	I guess it just couldn't handle, the stress, and the heat, the record heat,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, I was worried about every time we came to an intersection the car started idling rough, you know, because of the extreme heat.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know, my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and he, when he comes home from work, you know, during the Summer he's just he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an hour
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I know.
B:	Gosh.
A:	That's really awful,
A:	but, but I, uh, understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What I hate is,
B:	I hate having to water so much around here you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we never used to have to water our lawns
A:	No.
B:	you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there
A:	Sure.
B:	so here if you don't water it just looks awful.
A:	Brown.
B:	I just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is, that is awful and it, it takes time
A:	and the, the kids, they,
A:	you have to water your lawn
A:	and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy, You know,
B:	Yeah
A:	so you're going do I want a a green lawn or a muddy feet in the house.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have a dog too
B:	so that adds to it you know, traipse in and out with whatever the weather is like out there
A:	Oh, no
B:	so,
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	do,
A:	the nice thing I'm looking forward to is, uh, not having a hurricane season.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	because Houston was really hurricane alley, wasn't it,
B:	weren't there a lot of hurricanes there?
A:	Yes,
A:	we always had, uh, big concern about hurricanes,
A:	and they're close enough to the coast
A:	and, you know, you had to have a supply like, uh, emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season, you always have to think, you know, what's the weather doing,
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that would be,
B:	Gosh.
B:	Keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that?
A:	Right.
A:	And do we have enough, you know, um, food storage, and enough, uh, batteries and all the kinds of things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really, every time I store batteries, I wind up going to use them and they're dead
B:	they've been stored so long.
A:	That's right.
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	So,
B:	Well, now this is a little bit of relief, although they still have warnings all the time around here for, you know, tornado season hurricanes and stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, I,
A:	Well I, yeah, I don't really like tornadoes either,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, at least there isn't,
A:	we I feel like I got rid of something,
A:	hurricanes,
A:	so, not too much of that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up,
B:	I mean I have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn
A:	Yeah.
A:	and it is,
B:	so,
A:	and, I just, I can't believe the, the record temperatures that have, were here last Summer that,
B:	Yeah.
B:	a hundred and ten degrees
B:	and,
A:	oh, it was just unbelievably hot.
B:	And I can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that,
B:	I just don't even want to go out, you know, of the house to get the mail even
B:	leave me in the air conditioning.
A:	That is pretty bad.
B:	We had our air conditioning broke, break last last Summer.
B:	The switch got something wrong with the switch
B:	and we had to call somebody out to fix it, because I couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on.
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	I can't imagine.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Even,
A:	well, that would,
A:	it is just pretty bad,
A:	but I guess, um, I guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to Houston
A:	and, But it is,
B:	Yeah.
A:	like you say coming a little bit further up north. where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's really nice
B:	I hate having to leave the house you know, closed up all the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And get some fresh air in the house
A:	and, it feels good
A:	but, but, I guess,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, have you been here during the real heavy, heavy rains?
B:	I mean I can't remember what time of year,
B:	I think it's usually this time of year when we get some, just torrential down pours.
A:	No
B:	Gosh
A:	but I remember,
B:	flooding.
B:	Our neighbors had flooding, so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	They had to replace all their carpeting and everything,
B:	it was miserable.
A:	Now, that sounds awful.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That would not be fun.
A:	Now, I have seen those.
A:	I have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be at little yellow signs,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's, you know, has it like from one foot to four foot
A:	and I thought I would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	Oh, gosh,
B:	no kidding.
B:	Talk about asking for trouble, huh?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that would be awful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, I've got some kids out on the trampoline I need to go look and see what they're doing.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, have a good day.
A:	Well, you too.
B:	Thanks.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	So, what is your latest experience with painting?
B:	Well, I don't,
B:	I haven't done any painting since I was a child
B:	and my father would be painting and I'd ask him if I could, you know, take a turn or something,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	when we bought our home it was recently updated.
B:	They did that, maybe improvements, so they could sell it and things,
B:	so we didn't have to do any painting.
A:	Right.
B:	And the condominium we moved in before, my husband went over and painted,
B:	but I,
B:	the experience that I've had is that, um, whatever time he gave, said, Oh, it would take me about, just about four hours, because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there,
B:	and he said, Oh, it's going to be just about four hours.
B:	Well, he was gone the whole day,
B:	and he said, Well, all I got done was the taping around
A:	Isn't that amazing?
A:	It, it looks so easy just slapping paint on.
A:	I had an addition put on
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, we, and I decided, because my inner room looked so dingy, because I put these beautiful French doors in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, so I decided, okay, I'll just, you know, have them paint this little room, you know, a little ten by ten dining area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It took four days.
A:	And even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate.
A:	He said, Well, I'll be done this afternoon, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and pretty soon, before you know it, you know, he's run into so many problems,
A:	and it's just,
A:	there's nothing there to be a problem I thought,
A:	but, um, it just took him so much longer,
A:	and and he was there to paint the French doors also.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and if you've ever painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do because it looked so formidable,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, then, then just
A:	we, we got this painter,
A:	and I just called him because I got a little ad out of the, you know, the adcose or whatever in the mail, and, uh, you know, just got this painter person over here.
A:	And he said, Yeah, I can finish it in a day.
A:	Oh, right.
A:	so the whole project basically took a week
B:	Oh, I know,
B:	it's just awful.
A:	Funny.
A:	And I go what makes you a professional? You know?
A:	How much, you know, more do you know than I know about this whole situation,
A:	but he just kept painting on those French doors, you know,
A:	and each little, um paint stroke, you know, the paint wasn't going on right is what it was.
B:	Pane.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So he had to redo them like three times before I was happy with them, before he was happy, you know, that they even looked halfway decent,
A:	and so it's just been painting, yeah,
B:	Um.
A:	I mean, hire a professional,
A:	but that doesn't guarantee anything
B:	No,
B:	and it really,
B:	like you said, always takes way longer than anyone, um, is able to guess, because I know my husband he, he painted, when he,
B:	it was just the preparation time was so long. That when he actually got down to the painting part, he, it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done,
A:	Right.
B:	and, and, uh, he did part of the, in the, at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in,
B:	and, um, and he didn't notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans, he had finished one can off and started another one.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And then we went in there, you know, one was,
B:	they were white,
B:	but one had more blue to it.
A:	Oh, and that can make a difference, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, and they bring the, uh, you know, little samples
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you've got like maybe, five hundred,
A:	well that's an exaggeration,
A:	but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints,
A:	and you don't know what you to want to, put up there,
A:	and by the time it's on, I, I
A:	selected a, what I thought was white,
A:	and it was like you said, you know, it was blue blue cast to it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it looked awful on
A:	So that was the next problem.
A:	He had to redo that too.
A:	I
B:	Yeah.
A:	This was a,
A:	and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too, by the end, of the whole project,
B:	Right.
A:	but, you know, we worked something out, because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long.
A:	He really came over here to paint, I think, because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house
A:	I don't think he did the interiors very well
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	And, yeah.
B:	Well, I don't recall my parents having that much trouble
A:	No
B:	I mean, you know, they painted our rooms all the time,
B:	and we had a, a wooden,
B:	we hardly,
B:	we just had brick on like as accent on a certain area of our home growing up,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so he had to paint the outside all the time.
B:	and, um, I just don't think, you know, that there was that big problem
A:	It wasn't a big deal for them.
B:	No,
A:	I don't know.
B:	but to us, you know,
B:	we're going, oh, we're so glad we have a brick home, all we have is like trim around the windows or something,
B:	and
A:	I think my husband's really glad about that
B:	No, uh no painting to have to do.
A:	For sure.
B:	I, I don't know that
B:	like, uh, say, we're freshly graduated from school and things,
B:	so we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs.
A:	You just, you just get in there and do it yourself.
B:	We've been trying,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, we've done that the whole time we were in school. Like, trying to repair our own cars,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, so I, I want to get to the point where I could feel like I could just hire someone
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's, it's not that easy.
A:	It's like, it's, uh,
A:	I don't even know if I, you know, I would not even recommend this person again to anybody.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	A,
A:	I guess you
A:	I, I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say, Well, I'll accept something, or you just really have to get on their back, I mean, about things and, and working with what they say are professional painters.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean,
A:	I tell you what, the fumes that the, the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do
B:	That's true.
A:	I mean the fumes are amazing,
A:	and I, I don't think I could stay sane, you know and working with all that.
B:	No.
A:	So, I mean, I know it's not lead based any more, paints,
A:	but, my goodness
B:	But, still, it's harmful,
B:	and they have to live with that every day in, in their clothes and everything.
A:	I,
A:	well, yeah,
A:	I, think so
A:	Oh, it does.
B:	The only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the, um, association that manages it, they have to take care of like the structural damage.
B:	there was a roof leak,
B:	and that was not something that we had to pay for.
B:	So they sent their painters in to, to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then, you know, repaint the whole ceiling, in a certain room.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But they came in, and, um, they came in and did it and left in just no time at all,
B:	and I think it's because they, you know, they were accustomed to working in that environment, in those particular condominiums,
B:	and I don't, I didn't watch them,
B:	but I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it, the whole ceiling, you know, just within a couple of hours.
A:	Right
B:	And, uh
A:	Well, maybe there are some professionals out there
A:	It makes you wonder
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Really, it does, uh, for all that.
B:	Um.
A:	Well, um, I hope you have a nice day today.
B:	Well, you too,
A:	And you take care.
B:	I guess it's getting to be lunch time,
B:	I need to go take care of the kids
B:	but,
A:	Okay.
B:	You have a good day.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye, Kay.
B:	Bye.
A:	Well a lot of women are as knowledge about football as I am.
A:	Can I guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the Steelers.
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, I can understand that.
A:	I, you know, I kind of like the Cowboys, too.
B:	Do you?
A:	They've had some great games in the past.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I, I always enjoy watching the the, Dallas and Pittsburgh together. You know.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	me too.
A:	It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys, I'll tell you.
A:	He lives in the Dallas area now, as a matter of fact.
B:	Does he really?
A:	Well, actually, it's probably closer to Fort Worth,
A:	but it's, it's in the same area.
A:	He bought, uh, bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke, Texas.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often.
A:	As a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job.
B:	Oh,
B:	I wonder if he'd ever do that.
A:	I don't know,
A:	he'd be good at it.
A:	He's such a motivator, he,  primarily, you know, with the quarterbacks.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That would be his specialty.
A:	I wished, I wished they could work something,
A:	I really like him.
A:	I really do.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well what about the Houston Oilers.
B:	Do you like them?
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay,
A:	I'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl.
A:	That would be really great.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That may not ever happen,
A:	I don't know.
A:	Uh, Houston has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years
A:	and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And Warren Moon,  is, is proving himself quite well right now.
A:	That's right.
A:	He certainly is,
A:	he's very good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's very good.
B:	He's one of the few, uh, Black quarterbacks that there are.
A:	That's right.
A:	Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,
A:	but he's no longer with the team.
A:	So, you're right,
A:	there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How do you think the Steelers are going to do this year.
A:	You have any idea.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I hope they, they do better.
B:	They, they
B:	during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,  that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that was just such super team.
B:	Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well that's a tough,
A:	it would be tough to do,
A:	it really would.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They have such a super team for years, that won what, four Super Bowls?
B:	Yeah,
B:	four in a row.
A:	Four in a row.
A:	I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.
B:	Oh, I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.
A:	That's right
A:	And,
B:	But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,
B:	so.
A:	That's right.
B:	I think Mike Webster was left
B:	but then he, he just left.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh.
A:	He may have been the last of the old guard,
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think he is,
B:	I think he was.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	they had such a super team.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?
B:	No,
B:	I didn't.
A:	I see.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	There's quite a bit of activity now,
A:	of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.
A:	They picked up,  you know, quite a few of the,
B:	Uh.
A:	of course you never know.
A:	The guys they pick, you know, may never play a game.
A:	You never know,
A:	it's, it's a gamble,
A:	it really is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	They may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know,
B:	Well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?
A:	Ever been?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born
A:	his name was Sam Huff.
A:	He used to play for the New York Giants.
B:	Oh.
A:	That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life,  as far as, you know, dedication.
B:	Really.
A:	He just went all out every single play.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw, you know,
A:	there's been so many.
B:	Yeah,
A:	But if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact.
B:	Oh, you know, that's really funny, um,
B:	well, I, I come from a large family
B:	and, there's quite a few boys
B:	so that's kind of how I got in with the football.
B:	Either watch that or watch nothing.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, um, at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, but, even when Bradshaw was playing, I, I don't know, I, I didn't particularly care for him,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I thought he was kind of cocky or something.
A:	He is,
A:	he is,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	of course a quarterback has a big ego.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	They really they have to have,
A:	they can't survive.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Boy, he never gave up, I'll tell you.
B:	Yeah
B:	him and Franco Harris,
B:	I really didn't care for the either two of them.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
B:	I mean they were good,
B:	but, I, you know, you couldn't deny that.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	But I didn't, I thought, you know, well I just didn't really care for either one of them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, um, Lambert, Ham,  and, uh, Stallworth and Swan.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	absolutely,
A:	I can't disagree with that.
A:	They were super players,
A:	they really were.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They really,
B:	I, I, I like, not just with the Pittsburgh, I like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the, the best plays from,  you know, from the week or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	highlights, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I love watching that.
B:	Then I like watching their bloopers too, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact
A:	Some of them a, a bit embarrassing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well they make mistakes too, I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	it's funny that more people don't get hurt. You know, especially, I would say the receivers,  when they're in the air and they get tackled.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	oh they,  They take such a beating.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.
A:	Absolutely,
A:	I don't know how they do it.
A:	It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,
A:	it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.
B:	Yeah.
B:	An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.
A:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.
A:	Gosh, what a beating,
A:	they really do take a beating,
A:	they really do.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well what did you think of, um. a couple years ago for the Bears, the Refrigerator.
A:	I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think
A:	I don't know,
A:	I, I'm knowing what, you know,
A:	of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,
A:	I really am.
A:	He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.
B:	Oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he doesn't even look like he's in shape.
B:	He's just so big, no one can move him.
A:	That's right, yeah,
A:	absolutely.
A:	There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't,
A:	I don't know, you know,
A:	I,
A:	probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong.
A:	I, you know,
A:	obviously not very fast.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem to get out of the way.
A:	As far as him scoring touch downs, you know, I think that was kind of weird.
A:	I don't know,
A:	Dallas has a guy, uh, his name is Nate Newton,
A:	now he has a real weight problem too.
A:	He fights it every single year,
A:	but, he manages to still keep playing,
A:	but,  he has a terrible weight problem.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	They
A:	the coaches watch him all year long.
A:	They, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I guess most every team has has someone like that,
A:	I don't,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.
A:	Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you would, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, now who,
B:	would you say that you have a
B:	I mean other than Dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback.
B:	I mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	sure,
A:	well, you'd have to, uh, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I, I enjoy watching him play.
A:	Yeah,
A:	his age is about to catch up with him though.
A:	He's no Spring chicken anymore.
B:	No,
B:	but he's still performing.
A:	And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,
A:	Warren Moon's an excellent.
A:	But he's very exciting to watch.
B:	Yes he is,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure.
B:	I, I, I enjoy watching him also.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	absolutely.
B:	What about, uh, Marino?
A:	Uh, I'm,
A:	obviously he's a very good quarterback,
A:	I'd, I never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he may, uh-huh.
A:	Yes
A:	he was,
A:	I believe that's right at one point in time.
A:	but he's a very young fellow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	If not, he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,
A:	you
A:	Dallas did better last year,
A:	hopefully they'll do better this year.
B:	to someone else in the Uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I didn't, I don't know,
B:	I, I just think, you know Marino will get better
B:	and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl,  you know,
A:	That's right.
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Miami's had some down years, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they all do, I guess,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	That's true,
B:	and with age comes,  you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	with
A:	yeah,
B:	the, the
B:	I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,  you know.
A:	Oh yes, very much so.
A:	Hip injuries and things like that, yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and they're so young,
A:	That's right.
B:	but, they're retired, you know,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years.
A:	So that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.
A:	But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple.
A:	that's
B:	Holy smokes, I didn't that doesn't seem like very long.
A:	That's, that's a pretty short career on average.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But a lot of them don't, unfortunately.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, what do you think of the, uh, L A Raiders,
B:	used to the, the Oakland?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws
A:	and,  if their, if their, you know, arrest record won't let won't let them play anywhere else, they seem to go to, they seem to go to the Raiders.
A:	But that just may be, you know, perceived,
A:	you know perception,
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Al Davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy.
A:	Apparently he's kind of a wild guy,
A:	I don't really know for sure.
A:	They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.
B:	Yes,
B:	they have.
A:	I'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,
A:	they keeping talk about, you know, going,
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, uh, anyways, I'm not exactly sure
B:	I, I wasn't really, uh, paying attention as to what particular, uh, parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about,
B:	but it was, uh, basically what's your views on, whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used, that sort of thing?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	And, uh, I don't know,
B:	I've, I've always thought that any, uh, crime that, uh, that, uh, intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps, uh, doing it again, and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that, you know, there's a, a very steep penalty to, uh, be paid when that's done,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh. Yeah,
B:	how do you feel about it?
A:	Uh, I believe in it, too
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm Catholic
A:	and we're not supposed to,
A:	but, uh, I feel that it,
A:	like you,
A:	you know, on the premeditated murders I feel if you're, you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know,
A:	they really didn't do it.
A:	Well, you know, you, you got, you got that point well, you know, what, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	There's always that chance,
A:	I don't know,
A:	but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know what I'm saying?
A:	Like,
B:	Right.
B:	If, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, I,
B:	Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not.
A:	For some reason I was thinking that we do,
A:	but it's, you know, it's not very often.
A:	I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't think we,
A:	I don't,
A:	do you know if Virginia has it?
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
B:	No
B:	we don't.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know Florida has it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	they're always in Florida.
B:	Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, uh, some of the,  other southern states.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.
A:	Uh, you know,
B:	Get that unemployment way up
B:	so then people, you know tend towards crime,
B:	and then they they start stiffening the penalties.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But it's funny that, uh,
A:	I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania.
A:	I'm not even sure of that,
A:	but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that.
A:	And, it surprised,
A:	and even Florida, I know they have it,
A:	and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,
B:	Well, in Florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year.
B:	It's constantly on the,
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, you, you think that,
A:	I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,  you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.
B:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	that's true.
B:	Course they have a requirement that, uh, that every single appeal must be permitted.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, of course, the, the attorneys,
A:	Everyone would appeal.
A:	That's true, too.
B:	they go all the way up to the Supreme Court, you know.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	They almost always get thrown right back out again,
B:	but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I mean, they,
A:	And then they get out.
B:	everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they get out in three years on probation,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they do it again, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's like a slap on the fingers for them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't, I don't, I don't,
A:	I think that it should be,
A:	I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also.
A:	But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
B:	I think so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about.
B:	Although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be,
B:	they can't,
B:	I mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison.
B:	I don't think the parole system is really helping that much
A:	Yeah.
B:	Reduce the violence in the prisons.
B:	I think that's its only purpose is, is, you know, to reduce, uh, the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. Off earlier.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But some of these guys just don't care,  you know.
B:	And so, uh,
A:	I think some of them would rather be in jail
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.
B:	Um, that's possible I guess.
A:	I don't know, uh,
A:	I was just going to say something,
A:	I forgot what it was.
A:	Oh, I don't even remember what it was now.
B:	Um, so where do you live in Pennsylvania?
A:	In Clarion.
A:	Well, I live in Butler,
A:	but I'm at I'm at college.
A:	I'm at Clarion University.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	that's true.
B:	But, you know, our,
B:	like in our church, it, it is, your free to do that or not
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you,
B:	and, of course, we think it's helping other people.
A:	Oh, I think it is.
B:	And so,
A:	I really think,
A:	I think, um, people,
A:	you should,
A:	I, you know,
A:	the kids today I teach,
A:	I spend a lot of my time teaching college students
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I find great disgust in them, in their, in their, um, their self-centeredness and their inability to understand, um, multicultural or multiracial situation
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I really, you know,
A:	they don't understand, uh, how other people live, um,
A:	they don't understand,
B:	And they're preoccupied with, drinking.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's, uh, just having a good time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And
A:	I, uh,
A:	a friend of mine is a psychologist
A:	and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented.
A:	I guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented,
B:	That's true. paper
A:	and everything has to be an immediate reward
A:	and it has to be fun.
B:	That's really true.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here
B:	but at least, um,
A:	Well, they say,
A:	I think I, um, have read recently that, uh, the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because I guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe, uh, they've increased funding for the Peace Corps.
A:	Some of the, I guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense, you known,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	when they're decreasing some of the military spending, some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps
B:	Huh.
A:	and some of the are the overseas programs. Uh,
B:	Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what my, what I was going to study
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and at least I had some interest in,
B:	a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are, they say oh, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a lawyer.
B:	Why?
B:	Because they make a lot of money.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	And they don't have a goal,
B:	they don't have a goal,
B:	they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's very true.
A:	You know, how many,
A:	is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country,
A:	and I guess, I, I live near Washington, being in, in Baltimore, it's something like one in four people, in the Washington,  area, are lawyers,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and I just sort of think that's ridiculous.
B:	Yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and, uh, you know, the, the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and, and how come everybody is a lawyer, you know, you know
B:	There's just too many people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
B:	Not enough people want to do that to, for, uh, because of a service that they could provide.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country, um, but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	That's kind of sad.
B:	Well, anyway.
A:	That's interesting. Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I guess I better go.
A:	Okay.
A:	Hey,
A:	thanks so much for the conversation.
B:	Well, good luck to you.
B:	I enjoyed it.
A:	Well, thank you very much.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Thanks.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay
B:	Was I supposed to do something?
A:	No.
A:	I had to press one.
B:	Good
B:	Uh, let's see,
B:	so, uh, were we right in the Middle East?
A:	Sure.
B:	Should we have been there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did we do what was correct there?
A:	I think we should have stayed longer.
B:	Should we have fought them harder?
B:	Used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used?
A:	Uh, I think what we did was good,
A:	but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do.
B:	Oh, you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, uh, Drive on into Baghdad.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now.
A:	And it's almost like they're killing each other off
A:	and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all like
B:	Would that be so bad?
B:	Was there anything there to begin with?
A:	Well, I think, I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, um.
B:	It wasn't ours.
A:	Well, no,
A:	I just mean that, that, the world in general
B:	We've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I don't know,
A:	I think we should have helped the, the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more, than, rather than just quitting where we did.
B:	I agree.
B:	Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country.
A:	Yes
A:	But I think that's almost impossible, next to impossible.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So other political things that's going on.
B:	I heard Mister Bush say, excuse me, President Bush say that he, uh, wanted to improve the highways.
A:	Oh, see, I haven't really been keeping up with them
A:	so I really don't know what he said.
A:	What did he say about it?
B:	Oh, he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We don't have the money for that.
B:	But wouldn't it be wonderful.
A:	It would be really nice because I'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes
B:	And back east, you all drive at fifty-five, don't you?
B:	What's that?
A:	I'm sorry, I dropped the phone
B:	Oh, okay, um,
B:	I say back east you all drive at fifty-five don't you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	See, out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty-five
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we drive sixty-five.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Well, I, uh, last weekend, went home to visit my parents.
B:	My dad's in the hospital.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, between here and west Texas, there was probably three and four hours at sixty-five miles an hour.
A:	Oh, I didn't realize that.
B:	Nonstop.
B:	Have you ever been out here?
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
B:	How far west have you been?
A:	Only in Ohio.
B:	Oh, you've never, You've never seen the great American desert.
A:	I've never been past Ohio.
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
A:	I've never seen anything out, I never seen the great,
A:	I've seen,
B:	The Rocky Mountains?
A:	I've never seen,
A:	I've seen pictures of it
A:	but,
B:	Yellowstone?
A:	I've never been there.
A:	I've seen pictures,
A:	I just, I'm a college student
A:	and, um, I'm paying for my own education
A:	and I'm, I come from a large family
A:	and we, we we're never able to take vacations because there's, there's twelve kids in the family.
B:	Uh,
A:	So,
B:	Well, my college uh, thirty-six,
B:	worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	Uh, know, virtually nothing else.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	I got my four year, got my B S in General Science.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	it's a funny degree
B:	Anyway, uh, I know nothing other than the west.
A:	Yeah.
B:	In fact, uh, down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things I don't understand. Trees and the gulf
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's really interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So tell me about where you live.
A:	Well, um, I'm, I'm originally from Butler
A:	and that's about an hour away from where I am now.
A:	I'm at Clairon.
A:	And, um, it's, it's pretty, like, windy and hilly.
B:	Uh, how high is the highest elevation?
A:	Oh, I couldn't even tell you.
B:	Like, uh, probably
A:	It's not like a mountain.
A:	It wouldn't be like a mountain.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	three thousand feet?
A:	Oh, I don't even know.
A:	I have no clue.
B:	Close to sea level?
A:	I would say it's closer to sea level.
B:	Okay,
B:	uh, right here in Colorado Springs where I live it's over six thousand foot.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, yes
B:	when I lived in Texas, every year I had to drive, you know.
B:	I drove every year to the gulf
B:	and, you know, so I could have a feast of fresh seafood six, eight, twelve hours away. You know, just, just for fresh.
A:	Um.
B:	I, I'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How many hours have you been from home?
A:	Uh, the farthest away from home?
B:	Yes.
A:	I'd say five or six.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas,
B:	look at your map later and see the, the town of Amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	To just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour.
A:	Oh, my
A:	Oh, my Gosh.
B:	When I was growing up, Now things are different
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and people buy jeans in town,
B:	but uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Now see for me, that's a long ways.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It is I imagine.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Even, well, like, I, I'm in like a little town right now.
A:	It's smaller than Butler
A:	and, um, Butler, Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh.
A:	So that will give you some idea of where I'm at.
B:	Okay.
A:	And I'm about, I'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh.
B:	Okay,
B:	I'll look at my map later.
B:	Wow.
B:	How neat.
A:	And, uh, I mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town.
A:	The college, without the college here, this town would be nothing.
A:	It would be absolutely dead.
A:	Because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
A:	and, and in the summer when we uh,
A:	we come up here in the summer,
A:	and it's,
A:	I mean, there's just no one around.
B:	So are you working your way through college?
A:	Um, well, I go home in the summer
A:	and I work in the summer
A:	and between what I make in the summer and student loans, that's how I go to college.
B:	Well, how neat.
B:	What's your major?
A:	Finance.
B:	Finance.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, what do you plan to do with it?
A:	Um, well, like I said my fianc3ee, *typo
B:	Savings and loans, uh,
A:	No
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	no,
A:	and I'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something.
A:	I'd rather work for a company and, um, like be their financial advisor or something.
B:	Oh, that would be great.
B:	That would be neat
B:	Let's see, uh, so we're all excited in Colorado Springs.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Apple Computer is coming to town.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yes.
B:	The, uh, new employer is in the city.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we're expecting our local economy to Well, maybe not a boom, but, uh, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still.
A:	Take a boom a little bit.
A:	Well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?
B:	Uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent.
A:	See that's what it is here too.
B:	But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.
B:	Yes.
B:	It is.
A:	I know people they are out of school for two or three years
A:	and they have a job that has nothing to do ...
A:	Okay
A:	I'll let you go ahead
B:	Okay.
B:	I, uh, I have five children all together.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Uh, my oldest two are already out and about in the world
B:	and I, uh, have a set of twins that are fourteen
A:	Oh.
B:	and, uh, my youngest is twelve.
A:	That's great.
A:	I always thought it'd be great to have twins.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	If you like doing everything twice
A:	Well, yeah
B:	Uh, at any rate, um, my first two children, uh, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and, you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, uh, a full-time job that, was more than a full-time job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, worked about fifty-one hours a week, because I worked every, worked eleven hours every Sunday.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I, as I should have, as I really wanted to.
A:	Your first ones you mean, it, was this way?
B:	Yeah.
B:	The,
B:	yeah,
B:	the
B:	well, it was with all of them,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it was, uh, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because, um, oh, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, uh, when the twins were about three years old.
B:	And, uh, they never, you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much.
A:	Oh.
B:	You know, with all the children around the house, it's, kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around, very much.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, so, what I've tried to do, uh, now that I've, uh,
B:	went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours, a week.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I've tried to spend more time with, uh, the children since then.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, what I'm currently doing is, uh, taking a lot of time.
B:	I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings.
B:	Um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, uh, movies.
B:	There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the, movies.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, it's working out pretty well.
B:	Um, we're spending more time together.
B:	I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, uh,
B:	I have one son who's gone
B:	and I don't even know where he's at.
A:	Huh.
B:	Um, he's taken off for parts unknown,
A:	That's difficult.
B:	but, uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, my daughter is, um, has moved out of the house.
B:	Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house
A:	Uh-huh
A:	It happens that way
B:	And uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,
B:	and I think it's important that we do, because, uh, I notice that, uh, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a, uh, a me kind of attitude.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I noticed parents not spending time with their, children and, and going out and doing things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine
B:	and, you know, it just, you know,
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	I saw the family falling apart down, there.
A:	Texas is, much worst for the drugs.
A:	I mean, it was bad enough every place else,
A:	but drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And so, I think it's kind of important that I, that I, you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm doing my best to keep that up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's all you can do.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What's your, been your experience?
A:	Well, I, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work?
B:	Um, she didn't up until the last, oh, six months.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	She just recently started working then.
B:	She just recently, started working.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house
B:	and, uh, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient.
B:	And, uh, she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, that sounds great.
A:	Well, uh, we also have five children.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, but ours are all out of the nest
A:	So, uh, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things like you had, you know, having the time.
A:	When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, uh, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H, uh,
A:	and those activities helped a lot in, giving us things to do with the children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And uh, we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive.
A:	And, uh, our youngest is, uh, expecting her first baby.
A:	So, they're, they're all out and on their own.
A:	They're,
A:	and we have one to get married yet
A:	And they'll all be married.
A:	Uh, and they're, they're all doing pretty good.
A:	They, uh,
A:	T lives in Pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is.
B:	Certainly do.
A:	Okay.
A:	Two of our children live there.
A:	Uh, one, I, like I said, lives near in, in around Maryland, D C.
A:	He works right on the border of D C.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And one lives in Connecticut skips on Speaker A's
A:	and our baby lives just a mile over the hill so, we'll get to see her a little more than, uh, what we do the other ones.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That sounds great.
B:	I've, I've noticed, uh, another thing, um, when I was younger my father was always working.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, they have to.
B:	And,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, you know, he, uh, he worked a full-time job and a part-time job,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I never saw him.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by. You, know, to learn how to be a, a father and, a parent, and that kind of thing, because, I, I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or, catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad.
A:	To go, to follow.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that does make a big difference.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And it,
B:	if you don't have,
B:	I don't,
B:	I,
B:	it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
A:	That's, that's,
B:	but,
A:	well none of us are.
A:	Let's face it, you know, we're not none of us like they portray it on those shows.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, life's much more difficult than that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, mean, the, the, the capability to, uh, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, uh, the mental capacity to raise them
A:	And, uh,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And,
A:	Now, our daughter, our, well, she's our second oldest, she has, she's the only that, other one that has children.
A:	She has two boys.
A:	And, she works full time
A:	and I have mixed feelings about that.
A:	She's able to do that
A:	and I don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home.
A:	But, yet, on the other hand, I, I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children.
A:	I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way.
B:	Yes.
A:	But they seem to, they seem to give, uh, quality time to those children when they are together.
A:	And, and so, it seems, it seems for them that it works out all right.
A:	So, I don't know.
A:	I, I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family.
B:	Yes.
B:	It's, it's not easy.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I've, uh, you know, I've helped out extremely, uh,
B:	well, I can't say that,
B:	but I've helped out as best I could at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.
A:	Yes.
A:	It does, it, it,
B:	Even, if, even if someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done.
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What line of work are you in now since you went to school okay.
B:	Uh, well, now I work for Texas Instruments.
B:	So, so, I'm in computers.
A:	Okay.
A:	A lot of the people I've, that's I've talked to work for, uh, for the same.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	And so, I've, uh,
B:	prior to that I, uh, I worked in a food store.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know,
A:	Which your income would be a lot better, now.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It, uh, it was, uh, it was a, a smart move to make.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I was more intelligent than the position I was holding.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, it was,
A:	And it's, kind of a waste of a person.
B:	Yes.
B:	I, I, felt that it certainly was,
A:	You know.
B:	I mean, I was smarter than most of the people that I was working for.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, every time something new came up, I was explaining it to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I, had,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you, you recognized this and, was able to, you know, do something about it.
B:	No
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh, started back to school.
B:	In fact, I was going to school while I was working fifty-one hours a week
B:	and that's why I,
B:	you know if you're working, if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty-one hours a week, there's not much time left to spend with,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.
B:	Yeah
A:	And, the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can, because it's very easy to, uh, become, go your own direction when you're when you're working so hard and going to school, too.
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it, it all paid off.
A:	Well, that's wonderful.
B:	So, uh, you know, I got my degree and got the better paying job,
B:	and and, uh, you know, we, I think as a family we're a lot better off.
A:	Uh-huh .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It sounds to me like, uh, you're doing well.
A:	My husband's retired,
A:	so, uh, he's been retired for three years now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's quite a change.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, my goal is to try to retire by the time I'm fifty-five.
A:	Oh, well, he made it at fifty
B:	Great.
A:	It was a magic number for him
A:	and, and, uh, he went at fifty,
A:	and he still works part time at other thing, you know, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, nevertheless retired.
B:	Well, I'm
A:	Well, basically, uh, did you want to go first, then?
B:	Uh, well, I can.
B:	I, I don't own my home.
A:	Okay,
A:	right.
B:	Uh, I mean I, I live in a nice area
B:	and I rent my home
B:	and uh, we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here. In, uh, Texas,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think as far as, like, our home, it's, uh, in a small residential area.
A:	We're out of the cities quite a ways,
A:	so it's kind of more of a country setting
A:	and, uh, it's just a typical, uh, three bedroom type of home.
A:	It's, it's nothing, you know, elaborate where it has, uh, this or this or, you know.
A:	It's, it's just a typical home with, uh, three bedrooms, uh, two story type home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and I think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are.
A:	Uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes
A:	and yet there's,
A:	where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know, pretty typical of what our home is,
A:	so it's, uh, pretty much that, uh, type of, uh, home
B:	Uh-huh
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, our our house, we, we're renting it from an individual who bought it
B:	and he lives in Korea.
A:	oh, really?
B:	And, uh, he's recently moved here
B:	and he's owns eight or nine properties uh, near here
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, so, Which is just, uh, in trouble to me.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they're not very expensive either.
B:	It just seems like,
B:	we have a three bedroom house.
B:	Ours is one level only.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but we,
A:	So it's the rambler style.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have two, two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	So,
A:	It's kind of like what ours is.
A:	Uh, one of our bedrooms is really small
A:	and we've made that into a den because we only have one child,
A:	so that was our best way of going with, uh, the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller.
A:	It seems like they get incredibly small
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but, uh, anyway, but, okay.
A:	So that sounds great,
A:	and, uh, I don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever.
B:	Have you have you done this before?
A:	The T I?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, yes,
A:	uh, about three times before.
B:	Oh, have you?
A:	I'm fairly new to it,
A:	but it seems to be going okay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Are you in Texas?
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
B:	No,
B:	yeah,
A:	No,
A:	I'm out of state.
A:	I'm in Wisconsin,
A:	so,
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	So it's,
B:	Sounds interesting.
A:	Uh, other than that, sure, yeah.
A:	Is this your first time?
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
B:	I've, well, I've gotten several calls.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, uh, Yeah.
A:	I'm always the one that initiates the calls because I kind of like it because it's like I can get it done with
A:	I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls, you know, so, sooner or later.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, they've, I've talked to some people from Cleveland
B:	and I did talk to someone else who lives here in the same city I do,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so that was kind of interesting
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	sure.
B:	They're, they're sure getting their people out,
B:	so, well it was nice to talk to you, anyway
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, you take it easy, Gail.
B:	Okay,
B:	thanks.
A:	Bye, now.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	for as far as, um, I would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um,
A:	or, started to say the, uh,
A:	what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
B:	Probably so,
A:	and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's exactly it,
A:	and that's what we're finding, um, here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing,
A:	so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.
B:	I think so too.
B:	I'm in Texas
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and very few people carpool
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
A:	Exactly.
B:	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	or if somebody gets sick.
A:	Yeah,
A:	or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you're definitely right,
B:	That's right.
B:	And people don't want to give it up
B:	but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure,
A:	that happens quite a bit,
B:	but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah
B:	but
A:	that's very true.
A:	Uh, other than that, uh, I don't know,
B:	Well, my other line is ringing
A:	Okay.
B:	but we're going to ignore it
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	we'll try to be real quick here.
B:	I'm sorry for these beeps,
A:	The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk,
B:	Oh, close to five minutes, I believe.
A:	Five minutes, oh, okay.
B:	And you're in Minneapolis,
A:	Minneapolis area,
B:	Well, is the pollution really bad up there?
A:	Uh, actually no.
A:	We have, uh, quite a bit, uh,
A:	the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you get some pollutants such as those,
A:	but those are natural
B:	Yeah
A:	um, but there is starting to,
A:	in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution,
A:	and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air or other pollutants,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
B:	Well that's the way it has gotten here.
A:	at least where you .
B:	We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas
A:	Sure,
A:	yeah,
B:	but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's not a bad idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure,
B:	and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed
A:	Exactly,
B:	and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, they can't use,
B:	like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
A:	Sure.
B:	therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Sure
B:	But,
A:	uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	but it's uncomfortable
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done,
A:	and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,
B:	Um.
A:	and, I don't know if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I was thinking how many other people
B:	It's probably happened to millions of people,
A:	oh, sure,
A:	because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's that's right there.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car,
A:	and I, I thought about that,
A:	and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it
B:	Inhaled so much of it,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, of course in the, uh,
B:	I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
A:	Exactly.
A:	What do you like to watch on television ?
B:	Well, I guess a lot of the, uh,
B:	something that's kind of more of a comedy.
B:	We do have, uh, cable,
B:	and we have premium stations like H B O and Showtime and such,
B:	and I guess a lot of times when I first turn the T V on, I, I normally go to those, because I pay for them
A:	Yes
B:	I guess I, I want to see if there's anything I really want to see there, so I don't end up watching the, um, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, I tend to go to my premium channels first,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well we have cable,
A:	but we only have Cinemax,
A:	and uh, I think our favorite night is, uh, Monday night,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we start out with EVENING SHADE and MAJOR DAD,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know my husband's always got it on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not always sitting down,
A:	and,
B:	Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
A:	I just, I love that, all those, that two hours
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, now tonight I just finished up with that A WOMAN CALLED JACKIE,
A:	did you watch did you watch it?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	We had watched it, uh, I guess Sunday night and Monday night,
B:	but we didn't get to watch it tonight.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it was pretty good,
A:	it, uh, sometimes I like a dramatization,
A:	and I like, uh, U S A, when they had their, uh, uh, mystery movies and things, their made for T V movies
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I like those.
A:	We very seldom watch any, uh, Public Television, Channel Thirteen.
A:	Do you watch it much?
B:	The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight.
B:	They have some British comedy that we've, we've really liked,
A:	Yes.
B:	and there's a variety.
B:	Some of them is, uh, BLACK ADDER or GOOD NEIGHBORS or YES, PRIME MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED?
B:	They, they rotate those around,
B:	and, um, we like that British comedy.
B:	British comedy is very fast,
B:	you really have to listen
A:	Yes
B:	but.
A:	Now we haven't watched any of those.
B:	They're real good,
B:	but they do come on kind of late,
B:	but we really do enjoy those.
B:	Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel.
A:	Yes,
A:	now we have watched some things on that.
B:	And I'm amazed sometimes what I see on there.
B:	But I'm very intrigued.
B:	I, one time I was watching an operation,
B:	and I thought, Gee, I don't believe I'm watching.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we had, uh,
A:	I don't know,
A:	my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel,
A:	so, you know, and he's sit in front of it
A:	and, and he went by
A:	and he said, Whoops,
A:	and he backed up,
A:	and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm saying let's move right on
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	right,
A:	But our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here, because lots of times it will have things on, uh, animals
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	in fact, I think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, so we have watched that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football
B:	Oh.
A:	and, you know, I will watch that some if I'm reading or doing something else, you know with him.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not into watching sports.
B:	Now my husband likes to watch football,
B:	he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much,
B:	but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes to watch college on Saturday, and then of course Cowboys on Sunday.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside,
A:	and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much
A:	Saturdays and Sunday, this is fine,
A:	but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know, all of that,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around,
A:	I think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down.
A:	I don't know what channel he found that on
B:	Um.
A:	and, uh, but he will turn that on, especially for, if, again, if our, uh, oldest grandson is over here.
A:	He's ten
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it, I, you know,
A:	I keep telling them it's the same mentality you know,
A:	and something's wrong,
A:	and, uh, but, uh, and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night, because we're not home
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, so, and Sundays, uh, we usually have, all of our kids are over on Sunday,
A:	so, you know, we don't get into that, except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos
B:	Um.
A:	do you ever watch that?
B:	Yeah,
B:	the,
B:	you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh
B:	yeah,
B:	those are pretty good but true to life,
A:	that are sometimes so dumb
B:	I mean, some of the,
A:	But very true to life,
A:	I mean, I've seen our family in several of those situations
A:	Okay,
A:	you want to tell me first how you feel about the proposal,
B:	Well um, I, I just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at least something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service
A:	The boys
B:	right,
B:	the boys
A:	not the girls, the boys.
B:	yeah,
B:	and, um, so, but I think it would be good for all young people you know, to be able to, to do something like that um, so that, um, you know, I don't know, I just feel it would be good for them to do that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I thought it would be good, too,
A:	but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like that because I think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something like that,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done.
B:	Oh, sure.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of um, public service things that they could do uh, you know, drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah.
B:	and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it would be that.
A:	When they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,
A:	or are they actually,
A:	why, why, why did they call it a proposal,
A:	that,
B:	Oh, I think they just gave it a title
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or in work some
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's what I wondered.
B:	yeah,
B:	no, no,
B:	it's not,
B:	it's just a, just a topic,
A:	It'd be good character builder.
B:	I think so, too.
B:	I think so, too.
B:	Um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,
B:	so I think it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know, as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, Congress, uh, people
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, um, yeah,
B:	it would be, it'd be really good I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh, some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is, is good.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	oh yeah,
B:	I agree with you.
B:	This is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people, how they live
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	or,
B:	Oh, I agree with you,
B:	I agree with you,
B:	and I think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are
B:	Right.
A:	they have to see for themselves
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,
A:	I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I would think so, like right after, um, high school you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school you know, three months,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	yeah,
B:	but, yeah,
B:	you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now if they're not focused on going to college,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Kind of an in-between time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But as for its being required you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh type of a system. Um.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	No,
A:	and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,
A:	but not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean it's disaster if they don't go,
B:	Right.
A:	but but some of them are not,
B:	Oh, right.
A:	they're just not made to do that type of thing
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and they just aren't able to do it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	so, um, yeah,
B:	it'd be good
B:	but like I said, requiring it would be, uh,
A:	Okay,
A:	it's pressed.
A:	Are you still there?
B:	I'm ready
A:	Okay
A:	So what's, uh, things that you look for when you go out to dinner?
B:	Oh, I just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere and of course good food
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's always, that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax, you know because I don't really go out to dinner that much,
A:	Huh.
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, we don't go out to dinner that much either.
A:	We try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, I've been to some that's been terrible.
A:	You know, you see cockroaches crawling around and everything, you know.
B:	Oh
A:	But I try to get one that's nice and clean
A:	and then I like to, you know, good food and good service.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	where you don't feel rushed, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	and you can just relax, and stay as long as you want.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	So is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano?
B:	Well, nearby.
B:	We're almost in Dallas.
B:	We're just north of Dallas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we have quite a bit between us and there.
B:	It's about ten miles
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and there is all kinds of restaurants
B:	and, I had one that was a favorite for a long time,
B:	and then it changed hands and doubled the prices
B:	and then it finally went out of business.
A:	Um.
B:	So, but it was really nice.
B:	It had a fireplace.
A:	Um, that sounds beautiful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was really nice.
B:	They had entertainment sometimes
B:	and you could just really relax there and enjoy it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well. This is only a little small city.
B:	But it's gone
A:	Uh, we have, uh,
A:	excuse me, I didn't think my coughing would come back.
A:	Anyhow, we have only like one, uh, restaurant that's kind of nice.
A:	You know, they have prime rib on, uh, weekends
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they have about six miles from here is called, a little city called Wesley,
A:	and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food,
A:	and the atmosphere there is really, really nice.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	So, and then if we really want to, you know, something different we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city
B:	That is probably very fortunate for you.
B:	Do you have kids?
A:	Do I have kids?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I have a son,
A:	but he's grown up.
B:	Oh, because I have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night, you know,
B:	and now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so something's happened here,
B:	but, but, um, you know, McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list,
B:	and I hate these places.
A:	Yeah.
A:	All the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they, you know.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	they do,
B:	and I don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I'm sure there isn't.
B:	Well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work
B:	and you're tired
B:	and, you know, you just are tempted to give in to that,
B:	and it costs a lot of money to do it too.
A:	I know.
B:	You know, it adds up
B:	and it's not healthy,
B:	and I really got into that habit for a while,
B:	but I got out of it again because I just felt like it was just too unhealthy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Well, let's see, what else can we talk about?
B:	Well, how's California today?
A:	Oh, it's foggy and cold here.
B:	Is it?
B:	That's what I've heard, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	and it's.
B:	Have you always lived there?
A:	I came from Iowa when I was sixteen
B:	Oh.
A:	so I've lived out in California for a long, long time.
B:	And you like it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like it real well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we've been.
A:	We used to live in Oakland,
A:	so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there you know,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	but, uh, then I quit work and everything
A:	and I bought a house.
A:	I had a condo in Oakland,
A:	so, right in Chinatown, so we went to lots of restaurants Chinese restaurants,
B:	Oh, that would be fun.
A:	and they were really good,
A:	I really miss them. You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you miss living there?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	I really don't miss  living there.
B:	No.
A:	I just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, as far as missing living there, no.
B:	Um.
A:	It's close enough if I wanted to go there, to San Francisco for dinner or something, why, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know, have dinner and then come on back.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, have you ever been to California?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I go all the time.
A:	Oh really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there
A:	Um.
B:	and she, um, is a world champion twirler
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and her coach is in California.
B:	So she went there for six years.
A:	Um.
B:	So I went out a lot with her.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, yeah,
B:	I know California pretty well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I love it,
B:	and  we tug back and forth who's going to move,
B:	but I think he's going to move because I'm the person with more to lose here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I have my twelve year old in school
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she's happy.
B:	She always lived here in the south,
B:	and I have my house,
B:	so I have too much to lose,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that I hadn't voted in an election yet,
A:	and although I did go down and register and I,
A:	that's the first time I've ever done that.
A:	Has, what's been your voting experience?
B:	My voting experience?
A:	Well, do you feel like, uh,
A:	I mean, I,
B:	I, I, well, personally I've been very diligent until recent years. When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	For the issues that, you know, that I felt really strong for, uh, I think apathy has set in to a lot of people  because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's really true.
A:	That's kind of the way I have felt.
A:	I, I also feel guilty, uh, not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates.
A:	Course, we only have mostly the representation given in the media,
A:	but, uh, I have felt since I've been here that I haven't known what the issues were and that I, because it was a new community.
B:	You really do have to study to get yourself, uh, up to par with what is truly going on
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that takes a lot of research
B:	and  and people today are very busy
A:	It does.
B:	and uh, and that is an excuse because we are, we are always, uh,
A:	Yes.
B:	I know I'm heavily involved in other things
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and to take time out and, uh, study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I don't have the time to devote to that
A:	No.
B:	and, uh, you hopefully find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And unfortunately they are not.
A:	No.
B:	And, uh, it's really a dilemma, uh, that we find ourselves in, I believe. Uh,
A:	Right.
B:	So I kind of just have taken a back step away and, uh, hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Take it,
B:	because it is a task that is, to me, kind of overwhelming.
A:	Yes,
A:	and, uh, and, uh, I also feel, especially in the presidential elections that, uh, since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and, or that, and that you don't necessarily, your vote doesn't necessarily elect president.
B:	Right,
B:	they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes.
A:	Right
A:	and it's kind of,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it's awful,
A:	and, and it's hard to feel like one person,
A:	but I know that it's important,
A:	and I feel guilty that I haven't done that here, haven't taken the time
A:	and I know that, you know, people can make a difference,
A:	but it's hard to, to face the corruption, like you say, and, uh, and to know what you're up against.
A:	And it makes me feel bad that,
A:	I'm glad,
A:	I mean, I am thankful for the, uh,
A:	nineteenth amendment is it that gives women the right to vote
A:	and, uh, I'm glad that that happened and everything
B:	Yes.
A:	and I hope that I will become a better, make a better difference in,
A:	but I haven't done that so far.
B:	Well, I know that when you're in a smaller community,
B:	I live in Mesquite
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, when we have, uh, a local election, say for our mayor and so forth they really, uh, give a lot of information in the local newspaper, not in the, not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, they, they just give it a small portion of the newspaper,
B:	but the local newspaper really goes into, uh, quite a bit of history about the candidate
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, and then they have, they raise a, they raise two sides
B:	and, uh, there's a pro and a con side
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you can really, uh, feel comfortable in, uh, evaluating that, uh, candidate by, uh, that method.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth.
B:	Now, I wouldn't say that about the larger cities though, and the, and the country on, like, the presidential.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I mean, they've got people that are running that are admitted, uh, criminals and admitted crooks.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, I'm sorry,
B:	but I don't believe in them turning a good, uh, uh, a new leaf unless they have the Lord that has done that to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, without the Lord, they can't do it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's not very likely.
A:	I mean, it seems like
A:	You want to go first?
B:	Well, I believe that the, um, the voice, that, uh, initialized this call asked about, uh, if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action.
A:	Yeah,
A:	like the if, should the government make it universal or something like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yes,
B:	I, I, I, I would be committed to that,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You, you would be in favor of it?
B:	Oh, definitely.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I know that there are many countries that, uh, are very successful with the operation of the government, uh, providing that plan.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do they have options on who they, uh, you know, like choices of doctors and that type of thing?
A:	Do you,
B:	Um, I'm not sure how their program is run,
B:	but I know it has been successful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I would really have to, uh, read the history of, probably I, uh, the country that has fared very well with it,
B:	and I'd like to see the, uh, the data on that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's the way with me,
A:	I don't know a whole lot about it.
A:	I
A:	that's the only concern I would have, because I think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care,
A:	and if you didn't have any choice on, you know, in who you go to,
B:	Well I,
B:	Yes,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or to change even, like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	There, that's one of my main concerns.
A:	I, I have a friend that has, their boy has been sick for several months,
A:	and they just have found out what's the trouble.
A:	And they have gone through, uh, one, two, three, four, five doctors and then a team of doctors,
A:	and they finally determined what the problem was.
A:	It took that long.
B:	Yes,
B:	and the expense of that, yes.
A:	And that, that, something like that, you know, I thought, if you couldn't change or look elsewhere, you know, for help, if you
A:	I don't know how that program works, you know, if you can do that.
B:	Well, I would, I would think that they would have that as part, part of the benefit to the health care program, that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor, and hopefully that they would have their, um, accreditations there too.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	I guess that's, that's primarily was one of my thoughts, you know, because, you know how government is
B:	Yes, um,
B:	but those guidelines have to be set up,
B:	and I think they should be voted on by the public.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh,
A:	For them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	yes.
A:	It, it would.
B:	And of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be,
B:	and, um, I think that's primary, uh or an individual perhaps being single.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, I'm not sure what else that, uh, we could address, uh, on health care, uh, other than the fact, I think, uh, the eyes and the ears and the, uh, whole self should be, uh, uh, included in all of that.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, dental, eye care, and, uh, our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be, um, undertaken in a program like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know where my son works they have, uh, an option right now where they can have their own physician
A:	or they can choose one that their company has elected
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that costs them less if they take the doctor that, uh, that the company has selected.
B:	And does he have an option uh, if he doesn't care for the personality?
A:	He
A:	Well, only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense.
B:	Oh, I see
A:	Otherwise he you know, he has to take the physician that, uh, and the hospital that the company has chosen as their, you know, the one they have taken.
A:	And there again, I mean, he's gotten good service.
A:	He took the less expensive one of course.
B:	Well, if he's pleased with it, I guess that's, uh, the bottom line.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh.
B:	So, but I, I would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	cause there's always that opposite story there.
A:	Uh, cause that's the first I've really known anybody that, you know, works for somebody that they had that option, you know, to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they, what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's quite different from when I was, uh, under doctor's care, that's for sure.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I'm, I'm very thankful that I'm not under any doctor's care
A:	Oh If you have your health, you're wealthy.
B:	That's right
A:	You really are,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, we live in a rural area up here.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	what part of, uh, Pennsylvania do you live in?
A:	Uh, are you familiar with any of the area that all?
B:	Well, I have a brother that lives there
A:	Where?
B:	Uh, near, uh, Philadelphia.
A:	Oh, well that's, that's a ways away.
A:	But we live in Clarion County.
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Are you a native Pennsylvanian?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	so, I'm a former Michiganian
B:	so,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	That's a nice state,
A:	that's a real nice state,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yes it is,
B:	it's very lovely,
B:	it's a very lovely state.
A:	So I suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in, you know, like more populated areas as far as, uh the doctors that are available
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh
B:	I'm sure it is,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Of course we have good physicians here too,
A:	we've been pretty fortunate.
A:	We've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, we've been pretty fortunate.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That has broadened so much also.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	That is, the fields that, you know, are opening up are, um, just phenomenal.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	They,
B:	I mean, look at the AIDS, uh, case you know, I mean they, that's a whole new field in itself.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It's just, it's an auto immune deficiency
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it sure is a dilly one.
A:	It sure is.
A:	I still wish they could do more with the cancer situation, though.
B:	Yes,
B:	I do too.
A:	They, uh, they just don't seem to be,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, there's guidelines that people have to follow,
B:	and if they're determined to, uh, have their cigarettes and the other uh, carcinogenic causing items then how do you teach them?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess you,
A:	But a a lot of them don't do these things even,
A:	and it doesn't seem to matter.
B:	That's true, too.
A:	So, uh, it
B:	It's,
B:	I, I, I really believe our environment have a lot to do with it.
A:	Well, they say second hand smoke and that, is worse than smoking
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, so, what do you do, you know?
B:	Well, you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Take their rights away from them, they say
A:	I never had the desire,
A:	so I haven't ever had that problem, as far as that goes.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So I can't take any credit for not smoking even.
A:	So,
B:	Well, it's a bad habit that's,
A:	It's hard to break,
A:	it's a hard one to quit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yes.
B:	It's,
B:	they say that it is.
B:	Well it was nice talking with you.
A:	Yes,
A:	very nice talking to you too,
A:	and you have a good day.
B:	And, well, you do the same.
B:	And, uh, we'll be I guess talking around the country.
A:	Right
B:	Okay,
B:	you,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
A:	Uh, Kate, what kind of, uh, where do you like to eat out?
B:	Well, we, uh, we really like the Mexican food, you know, here in Texas
A:	Yes.
B:	and, uh, so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out,
B:	and so, uh, Tia's is probably our favorite, uh, restaurant there,
B:	and I think they have one of the best services that, uh, that we really like it.
A:	Do you?
A:	Have you tried Mother Mesquites?
B:	No.
B:	Where's that at?
A:	That's at Skillman and L B J
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	there is,
A:	it's where Skillman, uh, curves into Forest Lane
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's real good Mexican food.
A:	Another real good one is, uh, Rafael's down on McKinney Avenue.
B:	Oh.
A:	They're both very good.
B:	Really?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that, uh,
B:	no,
B:	we haven't explored, uh, you know, too many places.
B:	Um, you know, lot of the big name brand, I guess, uh, chains
A:	Chains,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah,
B:	but, um, oh, we've tried places, you know, down, uh, by the Collin Creek Mall,
B:	the, uh, you know, Alvarez,
B:	and, um, gosh we tried, what was across the street, El Paso's El Chico's or something,
A:	Oh, El Chico's or El Fenix one,
B:	yeah,
B:	something something like that,
A:	uh-huh
B:	uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh, much better.
A:	Uh, Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites
A:	but then fajitas are one of my, uh,
A:	I like it better than just about anything
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	and they make very good fajitas there in their own, uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful.
B:	Yes.
B:	Oh.
A:	Especially with butter and honey on them
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I know,
B:	I tell, I tell you what.
B:	They are, they just, um, they're excellent, uh, excellent food.
B:	I wish I could make them here at home.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	so do I.
B:	Just can't make those flour tortillas.
B:	But,
A:	Well, what else do you like?
B:	Well, I love, uh, I love seafood
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I notice they have like the, you know, The Louisiana Purchase, um,
B:	Razzoo's has opened up down, you know, off of, um, um, oh, close to six thirty-five.
A:	Yes,
A:	now I haven't eaten there.
A:	Have you eaten there?
B:	Yes.
B:	I have eaten there.
B:	Now the only problem, *note the setup for a negative comment
B:	I love the food.
B:	It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, the service has always been so strange, every time I've been in there.
B:	Mostly it's been at lunch time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, but I hear at night though they have, uh, you know, the outdoor, um, bar,
B:	and, um, uh, that's it's really, uh, you know, kind of lively.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff.
A:	Oh, I, we like, uh, uh, for the cajun, the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line, in Addison
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's a good restaurant.
B:	Oh, well that sounds great.
A:	And fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or, uh, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, uh, uh, Dallas Parkway in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	The service is great.
A:	They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the, the atmosphere is wonderful too.
A:	If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh well, I, uh, I have children and, and work,
B:	and so we, uh, we can eat a lot of fast food
A:	I can remember when our children were small.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We lived in the Chicago area at the time,
A:	and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out.
B:	Yeah
B:	I know.
A:	I can't look a McDonalds in the face now.
B:	I, I know,
B:	I, I'm so sick of McDonalds,
B:	and we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time.
B:	And, so now we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint.
A:	Well, Taco Bueno's good
B:	Oh and, and cheap too.
A:	And cheap,
A:	and cheap.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, but the kids, they've got those expensive tastes
B:	so, uh, they like Tia's
B:	so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes
A:	yes.
A:	Sounds like my grandchildren.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know.
B:	They, they, they're just spoiled rotten,
B:	but, uh, but, no,
B:	I, uh, uh, we love to eat out,
B:	of course, it's just so much easier and simpler
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	yeah.
B:	So we, uh, we usually eat out generally two or three times a week.
A:	Well, it's just my husband and I,
A:	and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners
B:	Oh, me too,
B:	me too.
B:	So, I know, uh, I, I know that I, uh, you know, I just work
B:	and I'm just tired when I get home
B:	and I, I just don't feel like cooking.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	no.
B:	And, uh, you know, on the weekends there's always things to do,
B:	and, uh, so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially.
A:	I like breakfast out.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I like the IHOP there in Plano.
B:	Yeah,
B:	now I, we've been there twice and, and both times I, just, oh, the food just didn't quite settle with me
A:	Oh.
B:	and I don't know what it was.
A:	Oh, now that's surprising because normally they're just, they're real good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yes,
B:	and I love.
A:	I like because they, they're, even if they're crowded, they're fast service, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, don't have to wait forever for a table.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	And we also like Owens, uh country
B:	Oh, family restaurant.
A:	yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
A:	We think it's good.
B:	Now I haven't been there
B:	I went to one I think in Ohio or, or, or somewhere up there,
B:	but I've never been to that one here.
B:	I know it's just down the street.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's good.
B:	So. Now have you been to Applebee's.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	And we like Applebee's.
B:	Yes,
B:	I, I really like that too,
B:	so that was, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it's fun.
A:	I like your, up there in Plano, that, uh, Country Steak House.
B:	Oh.
A:	Have you tried it?
B:	I've been, I've been there twice,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	so.
A:	We like it because it's fairly reasonable
A:	and they have, we go for the salad bar.
B:	Salad bar,
B:	yes.
A:	Nancy, do you have any children?
B:	Yes,
B:	I have a twelve year old,
B:	and I've been very lucky.
B:	I haven't needed child care except for my mom.
B:	So I've been real lucky.
A:	Oh.
B:	I'm a nurse,
B:	I go to school, I mean, I go to work early,
B:	so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready
A:	Well, that's nice.
B:	drives her to school,
B:	then I'm home to pick her up.
B:	So I'm very, very lucky
A:	That is lucky.
A:	Well, how old, um, does a child have to be before you have to, you get to stop making arrangements for him, I wonder.
B:	Well, I could do it now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But she gets lonely in the morning,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I feel better.
B:	Um, she has a crazy father out there somewhere that I just don't let her out of my sight.
B:	So, um  you never know.
A:	Well, and, um, it's nice for them  not to be alone.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	she feels that way, you know,
B:	and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we just feel better doing it this way.
B:	So.  I don't know what day we'll stop.
A:	Not after
B:	We, we were about to stop one day this year,
B:	and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats,
B:	and so we didn't stop.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And so, so, um, you know, you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen.
B:	So even though she's twelve, she's still a kid,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so you got to be careful
A:	She is.
A:	Well, I'm glad you have that, um, opportunity to have your mom.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm, I'm glad too
A:	Well, I, I have two kids and, uh, five and six, a girl and a boy,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, so far I haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because, um, I'm at home now full time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, when I was going to school, I would go to school a time that my husband wasn't, you know, when he was at home
B:	Yeah.
A:	so that we would just switch back and forth like that.
A:	But, um, it's really scary,
A:	and I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care
B:	Well, I would, too, because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside, we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I, I just don't know what I would do if  I had to do that.
A:	No.
B:	I know the hospital that I work in is a big hospital
B:	and they provide child care,
B:	and of course they charge for it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but at least all the nurses can leave their children,
B:	and they're always watching them,
B:	they can eat lunch with them,
B:	if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them,
B:	and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way. Yeah, *aa Well that's right. *aa
A:	Oh.
A:	Well, that's nice.
A:	And I know that I have, um, done some babysitting myself,
A:	and, uh,
A:	when I was in school and needed extra money.
A:	And I know how I feel, how I felt as a provider of child care that, even though you're, you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to, you know, treat them equally and, you know, better, usually, better than your own
A:	um, it's not the same,
A:	and it made me realize that, um, no one will love your child as much as you and your mother, your and, um, the family
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	and no one will look out, after them,
A:	and I just think, um, so far I think my preference would be rather than to have like a, oh, a big day care
A:	that, um, what is that like, child, Kinder Care and things like that,
B:	Right.
A:	rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something,
A:	I would prefer to have in home care, either my own home or a neighbor or something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Just never know.
B:	I babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced,
B:	and it was hard to treat her equally with my child.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They were the same age,
B:	and they played together,
B:	and they were good friends,
B:	but like you said, you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible
A:	Right.
B:	and so it, it got hard,
A:	It is hard.
B:	my daughter got jealous
B:	and, um, it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends, because she had to be there every day.
A:	No.
B:	So I stopped that after a year, because it was difficult to balance it,
A:	No.
B:	so.
A:	And I know, um, when I pick my kids up from school they want to come home.
A:	And I  and I would hate for them to have, be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation.
B:	They do.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. *b
A:	So I think, uh, my preference would be a small, small, if I had to find day care would be a small, someone that I knew
B:	Yeah, and I know that some parents, they both do have to work, *sd
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but a lot of people where I live are working just because they want bigger and better,
B:	and I would never do that.
A:	No.  in the day.
B:	I never have done it,
B:	and I just never would do it.
B:	I would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up.
B:	So.
B:	No  there isn't,
B:	there isn't any time,
B:	that's true.
A:	And, uh, by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time,
A:	and, there's just not enough to, time in the day to do anything good quality for them,
A:	but that's really,
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, I really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing.
A:	But, uh, just off the top of my head, I, I don't think I see much wrong with it.
A:	Um, if I owned a company and I wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that I had, uh, coming in, uh, were trust worthy, et cetera, and so on, I think I would, I would, uh, probably do the random testing just to insure that my company, uh, runs safely and smoothly.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I, I also haven't thought too much about it.
B:	Uh, but I suspect it, it very much depends upon the job.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Maybe.
B:	There are some jobs where I guess it doesn't really,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's, it's, it's, if it's not affecting someone's performance then I'm not sure if it's a problem.  If, if, if,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true
A:	I didn't think about that,
A:	like for instance,  Uh, if someone's working on heavy machinery,  or say driving trucks or buses, city buses or something like that.
B:	Right.
A:	Then that is something that affects the, that affects the community.
A:	You know, if you're, you're drinking or on drugs or whatever, you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands.
B:	Right.
B:	And then if you're a computer operator and, uh, there's really no big deal,
B:	I think, you know,  that maybe it's not necessary.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And for me, I think that drug testing, it follows the path that society is going in.
A:	If more and more people are using drugs then I think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	I mean, it's just, it's just where society is right now,
A:	and you know, something we have to cope with
A:	and I think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think it may, it may, that's in, in that respect, I think it may help a lot.
B:	I think it may be pushing people, hopefully push people away from drug use, If they no that, you know. *spelling:know
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that may be.
B:	If you use drugs, you won't get the job.
A:	That means one of the points of it.
A:	Of course I think, um, I'm not sure, you know, what the time span is,
A:	but, I mean, if I used drugs last week and I had a, you know, job interview that I wouldn't use drugs the day before or something
A:	and they wouldn't even see it.
A:	You know, what I'm saying?
B:	I don't know,
A:	They may not be able to trace it.
A:	I don't know how far they trace.
A:	I don't know what the, you know, limits are.
B:	I don't know
B:	that would actually be an interesting thing to find out, I think.
B:	I don't, I don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood, in the system.
B:	I've heard some, I've heard some things will stay there for six months,
B:	some stay for less,
B:	some stay for longer.
A:	Yeah. Oh, really. *bh
B:	Things like L S D, I guess, stay forever.
B:	In some ways,
B:	you get flashbacks for, uh, forever.
B:	I, I, I guess so.
A:	Something like that,
A:	yeah.
B:	I mean, there must be some, some, something,
B:	I mean, people get these little flashback things, you know,  of some sort,
A:	Um.  Yeah.
B:	so I don't really know.
A:	I mean, I don't use any drugs.
A:	I don't really drink or anything,
A:	so I'm pretty, uh, uh, I guess, decisive about that,
A:	just the fact that since I don't use drugs, I have no problem with taking a test.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, see, if you actually used drugs at all,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I'm, I'm at, at most a social drinker,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	so it's never a problem.
A:	So the only thing I would hate is if I were to go and, uh,
A:	I mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test.
A:	If you don't have anything to hide, you're not going to mind it.
B:	Right.
A:	And then there are some things that just aren't peoples business,  that come out at that point
B:	Right.
B:	That, that, that,
A:	so I think that a lot of people have trouble with that.
B:	But,  that's a fine line to draw.
A:	I can, I can understand that.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	I mean, uh, that's really
B:	do you, uh,  do you worry about, you know, this or that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, you know, what about the rights,  to privacy,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	what if they're doing something legal,
B:	but they would rather have it private,  you know.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	Like, especially in the case of drinking.
B:	You know, if someone is something more than a social drinker, shall we say, yet, they're not an alcoholic, what do you do?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	I mean, I took a lie detector once
A:	and I didn't mind it,
A:	but I was just offended by some of the questions, I guess.
A:	I mean, there was one question, do you like your mother?
A:	You know?
A:	I said, yes.
A:	Do you hate your mother?
A:	No.
A:	Have you ever killed your mother?
A:	And I was going, you know, What in the world.
B:	Well, those are just,
B:	yeah,
B:	Those are just to get, probably to get some sort of, those are to get the shock value out of you.  Shock.
