A:	I'm sure they are.
A:	That's right,
A:	I'm sure that true.
A:	It's a lot different than working in a kids preschool.
B:	A lot different.
A:	That's right.
A:	Well, you all have a nice day there.
B:	You too,
B:	and thank you for calling.
A:	Thank you very much.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
B:	Do you have any?
A:	Sure.
A:	I have a Springer Spaniel,
A:	and her name is Thumper.
A:	She's about seven or eight years old.
A:	I got her for Christmas from my family, and, uh, back when we lived in Nebraska.
A:	I like to hunt,
A:	and, uh, so, I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that, boy, I could just go out and get all kinds of game
B:	Did it work?
A:	Yeah,
A:	except we live in Plano, Texas now
B:	No,
B:	right.
A:	so
B:	I, um, I had a, for many years I had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel.
B:	I just love them.
B:	Her name was Molly,
B:	but she isn't alive any more
B:	We had her for, um, fifteen years, I think, my family did, and just loved her.
B:	She was the greatest, greatest, um, went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle.
A:	Do you have a pet now?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have a cat now.
B:	He just turned seven, also,
B:	and he's, I, um, got him in Arizona and, when I used to live there,
A:	Oh.
B:	and he is huge.
B:	He is eighteen pounds.
A:	What kind of cat is it?
B:	Just,
B:	um, I got him,
B:	he was, um, he was born in the wild, like in a, in a shed and had never been in a building when I got him.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So he,
B:	and he's, he, he must be part, cross part with some kind of desert animal, because he's very long and lanky,
B:	but he's a very tame spoiled house cat, you know, now that I've had him for seven years.
A:	Being born outside, you didn't have any problems house training him?
B:	No,
B:	no
A:	That's good.
B:	he's,
B:	yeah,
B:	he's great,
B:	and uh, he's, uh, he's really spoiled, though
B:	So, but he's really big,
B:	so, lots of times he, it, he seems to get in fights,
B:	and when he was younger I think he started them,
B:	and now, I think he barely makes it.
B:	I think he gets beat up even though he's big, because he's pretty much overweight, and comes home with a few scratches now and then,
A:	Sure.
A:	And older
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town,
A:	and, uh, we thought that, we have a cat now,
A:	but we thought, Well, if we ever get another cat, you know, we'd want something kind of unique,
A:	so, we kind of looked around,
A:	and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats
A:	and we sort of fell in love with the, uh, Maine Coon cats.
B:	Oh, I've seen them.
B:	I
A:	They're huge.
B:	yeah,
B:	I have seen them.
B:	They, um, weren't they, they were
B:	actually, I can't remember,
B:	they were used to be used on ships and in, for, for mousers you know,
A:	Oh.
B:	so they're very nautical, too
A:	I'll be darned.
A:	I didn't know that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just,
B:	uh, I think I'm, I think I'm being accurate in the, in the area of folklore,
B:	but I'm not sure.
A:	Well that's interesting.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We kind of like,
A:	well, my family didn't necessarily like, like them as much as I did,
A:	but the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail
B:	Yeah.
A:	it sort of has a bob tail.
A:	I kind of like that, too,
A:	but.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'd love to go to a cat show.
B:	I'm real, a real cat lover.
B:	I'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let let me
B:	He doesn't really like mine, let alone another one.
A:	Well, I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog,
A:	and then I suppose our five minutes will be up.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	I work for a university,
A:	and I went to, uh, Omaha, Nebraska to recruit students,
A:	and I had some time off in the afternoon,
A:	so I went to a, a pet shop,
A:	and I saw these little Springer Spaniels
B:	Um.
A:	and so I decided, well, you know, this would really be a nice dog to have,
A:	so, when I got back home to Carney, Nebraska, I told my wife about it,
A:	and I said, You know, this is just a,
A:	I, I, I can just hear the dog crying for me now
B:	I know what you mean.
A:	And Christmas is coming up, hint, hint,
A:	and so, I had to go back the next week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university,
A:	and one of the people, uh, that we went with, uh, they were friends of ours,
A:	and so, we got to Omaha,
A:	and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog,
A:	and so I got over there,
A:	and she said, Oh, that's too bad, the dog has already been sold.
A:	And I didn't realize it,
A:	but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog,
A:	and she was in the back room,
A:	and so that night we had a reception for some of the, uh, potential high school students or college students,
A:	and, and, uh, he had the dog the whole time in his room,
A:	and, and I had no idea.
A:	And so we headed back to Carney that night,
A:	and the dog rode in the car
A:	and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat
A:	and they left the dog in the car,
A:	and I guess while we were inside eating, Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car,
A:	and, uh, finally we made it back to, uh, to Carney
A:	and,
A:	I guess we're recorded.
B:	Okay.
A:	What,
A:	do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Cycling, computers, uh, backpacking, just about everything.
A:	Oh
B:	Oh, I generically have, you know, millions of hobbies.
A:	All right,
A:	that's an interesting assortment.
A:	My husband is into cycling.
A:	In fact, he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the, the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm not quite that bad.
B:	I'm just a weekend cyclist.
A:	Uh, do you have any, do you do any handicraft type things, I think was the question.
B:	Handicraft type things.
A:	Yeah,
A:	whittling or
B:	Yeah,
B:	just whittle away my life.
B:	Uh, no,
B:	no,
B:	I
A:	Nothing like that.
B:	Uh, uh,
A:	I, I do some things.
A:	I've gotten into,
A:	uh, oh, I, I like to decorate things
A:	and I do sweatshirts and T-shirts
A:	and I've gotten to where I start, have started selling them at craft shows and things.
B:	Oh, that's pretty good.
A:	Uh, and I have, have done fairly well at them.
A:	I've had
A:	a, a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed,
A:	but most of them have worked out pretty good
B:	Yeah,
B:	they,
B:	my only craft work is kind of like computers and, you know, go off to the little computer club meetings,
B:	and, it's kind of nice because I've made money at it, too.
B:	Considering I, I work for it a living,
B:	but I, you know, I, I've got a couple of articles published.
A:	Oh!
B:	It's kind of, kind of neat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what, what does a computer club do.
A:	I didn't know there were such things.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	just all over the place.
B:	They just get around and, and talk techy or, or else, uh, uh, you know,
B:	like half the members are really expert
B:	and the other half are like really not.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we kind of help out the people who are really not
A:	You don't, uh, you're not into hacking or whatever
B:	Oh, I, I think I'm, I think I'm a hacker,
B:	but I'm not, not kind, not the, uh, the, you know, dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	no,
B:	that's one of those sports I don't go for.
A:	Well, that's kind of interesting hobby.
A:	What else, did you,
A:	you said you did cycling?
B:	Yeah.
A:	What was the other thing?
B:	Backpacking.
A:	Backpacking.
A:	We,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I belong to a, a Boy Scout troop.
B:	It beats paying United Way.
B:	I just, you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's, we have done that.
A:	Uh, our two older boys were in Boy Scouts
A:	and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so we've uh, done a fair amount of that in our spare time, also
A:	But, it,
A:	I,
A:	that's a great thing to do, you know, really.
A:	Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting?
B:	Uh, well, just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest which is kind of out in east Texas.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we go to, uh, places out in,
B:	uh, uh, let's see
B:	what's that, what's that state north of us,
B:	that state
A:	Oh, that one.
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that one.
B:	That one.
A:	Okay
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	And,
A:	To the,
A:	uh, oh, by Fort Sill there?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	to another a, uh, old Indian fort that's out there.
B:	Trying to think of the name of it.
B:	Durn.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	no,
B:	sorry,
B:	no memory.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you gone, like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts?
B:	No,
B:	I missed out this last year.
B:	I wasn't able to get the time off, but maybe next year.
B:	It's a good possibility.
A:	I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	When I was a kid, uh, we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras.
B:	That was loads of fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Does, does your whole family like to do it,
A:	like you, you know, for a vacation you'd go backpacking?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	not quite because I'm not a whole family.
B:	I'm just me
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	You just, oh,
A:	and, and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts, huh?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I rent my kids
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Well, sometimes, uh,
B:	It's better than, you know, owning on them and making payments on them, and, you know, things like that.
A:	Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea
A:	Have,
A:	uh, you said you did it in the High Sierras.
A:	Uh, do you ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, not recently because, you know, like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month, you know. Someplace.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that.
B:	So, you know, they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you, which seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing
A:	Well, I,
A:	probably,
A:	probably.
A:	That's,
A:	uh, well, my, my other things that I like to do in my spare time, I'm, I like swimming.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Which is in now.
A:	I've done that
A:	and I, I also,
A:	when I like something, I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it.
A:	Okay,
A:	is it Mike?
B:	Yes.
A:	Do you repair your own car?
B:	I try to, whenever I can.
B:	I've always been a, a I guess a product of a handyman father.
A:	Well, I tell you what, that's, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	There's,
B:	although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the cars get more complicated.
A:	Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they?
B:	Yes.
B:	One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick. Which, after awhile I could, you know, take it apart in my sleep if I needed to.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah.
B:	It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
B:	and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know about it.
B:	And then start getting into these Nissans and the like
B:	and I just can't keep up.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I agree.
A:	About all I ever,
A:	I never was too mechanically inclined,
A:	but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Course, they don't use, uh, points anymore.
B:	That's right
A:	But, Uh, they do still use plugs.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.
B:	Yes.
A:	I don't anymore,
A:	but I have on a lot, a lot of times.
B:	Yes,
B:	I understand.
B:	My last car repair actually had to do with brakes
B:	and it's one I did not do myself.
B:	I took the car, my,
B:	I have a seventy-nine El Dorado, took it to be inspected
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the parking brake failed.
B:	So I got under there and messed with the, the that, uh, that adjustment to make, to tighten it up
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that didn't do the trick
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I got there and tried to,
A:	It probably slipped loose, didn't it?
B:	Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.
B:	I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it turns out that there's a,
B:	the parking brake in the rear,
B:	there's a, there's disc brakes
B:	and the parking brake is a piston deal.
A:	Um.
B:	And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up.
A:	Oh.
B:	So they ended up having to pound it out.
B:	And one of them, they, were able to get running, uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it
B:	and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid,
B:	so I ended up having to buy one
B:	and all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done
A:	well, it really wasn't quite, as bad as you thought, was it, was it?
B:	yeah,
B:	actually, I, I think it was a lot of money,
B:	but I, I don't, like I
A:	Well, it was a lot of money,
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, I,
B:	it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on
B:	so,
A:	You had to have the help, didn't you?
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, do you still do much work on them, then?
B:	I do.
B:	actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September
B:	and, whenever I can, I do try.
B:	I
B:	actually, I'd say this.
B:	I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because,
A:	Disposal is a problem.
B:	Well, that is one problem,
B:	but also these, uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them.
A:	That's true.
B:	For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, uh, lube, too
A:	That's true.
A:	Right,
A:	that, that,
A:	I've, I've quit doing that myself.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.
B:	Yep,
B:	that's right.
A:	And, uh, but, it,
A:	but, no,
A:	I guess,
A:	that,
A:	and the main reason that it's, it's quick.
A:	Well, have you seen a new movie lately?
B:	Well, uh, I am a student
B:	and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video, than being able to go out to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.
A:	Okay.
A:	I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.
A:	Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?
B:	Uh, let's see.
B:	Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.
B:	Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.
B:	Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.
B:	What have you seen recently?
A:	Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yes.
A:	What did you think of that one?
B:	Enjoyed that quite a bit.
B:	Um, I thought the, uh, the the cinematography was excellent.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the story was,
B:	uh, though it tended to be a little one sided uh, it was good.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it was, it was believable.
A:	I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,
A:	and that's when the movie was filmed,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went,
A:	uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.
A:	In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.
B:	Wow.
A:	Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,
A:	and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all looked at the buffalo,
A:	it was really neat.
A:	But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or, you know, they'd start recognizing people.
B:	They knew, they knew the extras or the,
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.
A:	I'd go now, now which one could that be you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,
B:	Scope.
A:	Right.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, but I, I thought it was a good film.
A:	But you are right,
A:	I think, I think it was very one sided.
B:	It, it was,
B:	but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.
B:	I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,
A:	Sure.
B:	and it's just, shoot the Indians,
B:	and they are always the savages.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night
A:	and, it was a similar, uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but it was an interesting movie.
A:	Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?
B:	Yes.
A:	Now I thought that was a good show.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That was, that was a good movie.
B:	Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Kind of,
A:	It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing
A:	or, uh, and it wasn't really a comedy,
A:	but it was an enjoyable movie.
A:	It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS series, you know, just something a little different,  yet believable.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Yes.
B:	You're bringing it,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.
B:	But, yeah,
B:	I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,
B:	and, uh,
A:	Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,
A:	are you going to see this next one that's coming out?
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	Have you seen the rest?
B:	Yes.
A:	I think I've missed one.
A:	I'm not sure,
A:	but I think I've missed one.
B:	I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,
B:	and they showed all five in a row.
A:	Was that here in Dallas?
B:	Oh, they had it everywhere,
B:	uh, every major city had one theater that did it
B:	and,
A:	Okay.
A:	Because we had one here in Dallas.
B:	Right,
B:	and they did it in Houston,
B:	they did it, well, they did it everywhere.
B:	And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,
B:	and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another and just no, no time between them,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you can watch the characters develop,
A:	I said Arlington, Texas because the other day, I was talking with somebody
A:	and he was in Arlington, Virginia
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the only one I've got now for this area.
B:	Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.
A:	Well, anyway, we've got a easy subject.
B:	Yes,
B:	we do.
A:	You go ahead first, if you'd like.
B:	Okay,
B:	let me think here.
B:	Favorite,
B:	I haven't been watching much T V lately
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know you get so busy.
B:	I used to.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have, uh, I have one favorite soap opera.
B:	I still watch
B:	and I tape because I'm not home
A:	Oh,
B:	And, uh, let's see,
B:	that's GENERAL HOSPITAL,
B:	and then, uh, at night, uh, I don't, uh, when I sit down, I don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed
A:	I know.
B:	and, and, uh, then I watch,
B:	uh, what do I watch at nine o'clock.
B:	Let's see,
B:	oh, well, Tuesday nights I guess, we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Are they little?
B:	I have a seven year old and a ten year old.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're pretty young.
B:	And, uh, so we usually catch, uh, FULL HOUSE,
B:	and, uh, what's the one comes on after that.
B:	It's a new one, uh,
A:	I don't know,
A:	my kids are older
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I don't, I don't know some of those shows now, like I used to
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, other than that, uh, oh, gosh. I watch KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights, for pure entertainment, nothing else.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well I, I like the comedies.
A:	They're just light, too.
A:	I have to watch MURPHY BROWN
A:	I really like,
B:	Oh, now that is a good one.
A:	I make a point of that.
B:	That is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	if I'm home on Mondays, then I, I definitely watch her.
A:	I love that
A:	and I really like COACH.
A:	I think it's, when it's good, it's just a scream.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, he's a good actor.
B:	He really is good.
A:	Well, he's probably playing himself.
A:	Half the time you see these people on an interview show, they're, they act just like they do in their parts
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	He,
A:	I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once
A:	and he acted about the same
B:	Oh, God.
B:	Well, he could very well be
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh,
B:	So, do you watch much T V,
B:	or,
A:	Well, I watch more now because, well I, I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but this semester I'm only taking one course
A:	and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS.
A:	I just make a point of seeing those.
B:	Now, I never see that.
B:	Well, I've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show.
A:	Oh, it's fabulous.
A:	Really, you should never miss that.
A:	It, they are just gems of shows. I mean, they really, fabulous in every way
B:	Oh, nice.
B:	What, now what night is that on now?
A:	Oh, that's Wednesday at, uh, seven thirty.
B:	Wednesday at seven thirty,
B:	oh, okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Wednesdays I, I go to church choir,
B:	so That's my one night out and about,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	so,
A:	Sure,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I should get him to do that.  Because I know,
A:	Just so you get the idea.
A:	It wouldn't take,  Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So, so, I watch those.
B:	Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like
B:	or,
A:	Well, you know, I haven't, oh,
A:	yeah,
A:	we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE.
A:	Well, it's not really new,
A:	but it's still kind of new.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	How's that?
B:	I haven't seen that.
A:	I like it a lot.
A:	It's real different.
A:	In fact, they never thought it would be a hit.
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean, they'll have some things in there that almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something,
A:	you know, I mean, somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does
A:	or, I mean, it sounds weird,
A:	but, it's very, uh, unique show and very well done.
B:	Huh.
A:	Excellent actors.
B:	I'll have to watch for that.
A:	I, I guess we just,
A:	it came on after something we used to watch
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and I guess we just kept sitting there
A:	and then now we make a point of watching
A:	I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Well then, it will be mostly reruns, I guess
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.
B:	Gosh. Well, we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN,
A:	But, uh,
B:	but, uh I haven't seen that much lately. Since they got rid of, uh, Delta Burke and, uh brought on the new ones.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen that.
A:	Was she the, was she the best one? Was she the best one on that old show?
B:	Oh, she was just funny.
A:	Really?
B:	She was really funny.
B:	And her character was good.
B:	I don't know that it was her in particular but just the character.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they had a big fight on that show, didn't they?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	They were all accusing each other of everything in the world
B:	Oh, that was awful
B:	and who knows still, what really happened, you know.
A:	Well, I know,
A:	gosh, you never will, probably.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	so,
A:	Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable.
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	I don't have cable.
B:	Now I told ,
B:	no,
B:	we don't have that station either,
B:	so, uh, I haven't been able to catch any of that,
B:	but just what little we caught on the news.
A:	It's just as wild as any soap opera, from what I hear on the news.
B:	Oh, I know it.
A:	And I think he's guilty as the devil.
B:	Well, I don't see how he couldn't be, you know.
A:	I know,
A:	what's in it for her.
A:	There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those rich high powered lawyers.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
B:	Oh, and they said this lawyer is unbelievable.
A:	Um.
B:	But, they said she held up so well yesterday.
A:	I know,
A:	everybody was saying that
A:	and then, in the paper said it
A:	so, It should be interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, God.
A:	Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says
A:	I was reading that in the supermarket line.
A:	I never have the nerve to buy the thing.
A:	Uh,
B:	Oh, shoot,
B:	well, do you watch any, uh any sports or anything like that
A:	Says he,
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	I don't care anything about that.
B:	Because I don't either.
B:	I can't, I can't watch it on T V,
B:	so
A:	I like the ice skating,
A:	you know, occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I always watch that.
A:	I think it's so beautiful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes, too.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that's good.
B:	Well, I suppose we both have credit cards.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	they seem to be a part of life
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	how do you use them?
B:	Well, I do use them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I have a few favorites that I use more than others
B:	and, uh, I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable.
B:	I, I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when, when you start using more than a few
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, they all can build up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I think they're handy.
B:	I just get, uh,
B:	I don't carry a lot of cash with me
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I hate writing checks when you go shopping.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, do you use credit cards?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I use a few.
A:	I, uh, I watched my grandmother go into debt on them
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I've,
A:	and then I guess my  mother,
B:	Grandmother
B:	huh?
A:	Yeah,
A:	so my mother learned from that
A:	and I guess she taught me to be very, very careful with them.
A:	So basically, uh, I just keep them,
A:	I use them so that I build up a credit rating, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, otherwise, uh, I generally,
A:	and my husband, it turns out,
A:	I've just been married seven months,
A:	but he has the same habit
A:	and we just keep a few you know, few of the major ones, and then use them once in a while for something,
B:	That's good.
A:	but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge.
B:	Oh that's, That's wonderful.
A:	So that way we keep out of debt
A:	and we keep on top of what we're spending.
B:	Well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high now  compared to what your savings is bringing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's really, I guess ridiculous to let them keep building.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's what I feel.
A:	So,
B:	But I know some people can get, get, you know, carried away with them and let them get out of hand.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you, you charged that or charged that.
A:	I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come,
A:	but sometimes I forget
A:	and so, you know, a bill will come in
A:	and I'll think, oh, no I didn't know it was going to be that high.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	But so far, I've been able to, we've been able to pay it off every time
A:	so,
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	I'm looking, right now I'm kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate.
B:	It seems that some of them have gotten higher
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I saw on T V, they had a program on, uh, credit cards
B:	and they're supposed to,
B:	I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some, some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country.
B:	And I didn't write it down at the time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I went and looked and, to see what my visa was
B:	and I think it's eighteen percent or something
A:	Um.
B:	so, think I want to find something that has a lower rate.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you ever used Discover card?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off
A:	but you know,
B:	Is that the one from Sears?
A:	Uh, I think Sears originally put it out,
B:	Okay.
A:	but it's, uh, it's pretty well taken all over the U S now.
A:	I mean, uh, I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover.
A:	And there's no annual service fee, which is good.
B:	Okay .
A:	You know, and then, uh, they also give you, they say cash back, uh, like at the end of the year.
A:	For the amount that I charge, I get two dollars back or something
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.
B:	Oh, they give you money back for using your credit card.
A:	Yeah,
A:	basically.
B:	Oh
A:	That's it.
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	And I think the service charge is pretty low, too,
A:	but, I'm not sure.
B:	Um. Well, you know, Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I worked at Sears for over ten years
B:	and, uh, it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card, another credit card that was accepted,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, you know, now they'll take the Discover,
B:	but I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh  I never did apply for a Discover card.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just figure with the Visa and American Express, I probably have an,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can do enough damage with those two.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it's best to keep the number down that you have.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	I've got some that I, you know, I haven't even used at all, uh, past few years
B:	I probably wouldn't be able to use them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I, I do like my Dillard's,
B:	I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I do use Dillard's probably as, more than any of the other department stores.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, Do you have anything else to say?
B:	Well,
B:	No,
B:	not too much more about credit cards
A:	Okay
A:	I don't think I do either
A:	so,
B:	Okay
B:	well,
A:	Well, it was good talking to you.
B:	Good talking to you Beth.
A:	Okay.
B:	Good luck.
A:	Have a good evening.
B:	You, too.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime
A:	or is that a crime free zone there?
B:	No,
B:	I don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer.
A:	I'm afraid you're right.
B:	Uh, one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, oh, well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams
B:	and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	And they had stopped a, uh, a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	and then the other one was on the roof in the back.
A:	By your house?
B:	on my house
A:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Aye, aye, aye Oh, my.
B:	So I'm very much aware of, uh, crime in the cities and the, and the concern about it.
A:	That's, that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening.
B:	It was.
B:	I, uh, I kept hearing noises
B:	and so I, I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage,
B:	so I got a my gun and walked to the, you know, through the house into the garage.
B:	There was no one there,
B:	but I wanted to be sure.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	Is Plano beginning to experience the, the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan, you know, in the urban area?
A:	Unfortunately yes.
B:	That's too bad.
A:	Yes.
A:	I think, uh, you know, as any city grows up, uh, you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think,
A:	uh, you know, fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek,
A:	but, uh, we've been, we've lived here sixteen years
A:	and now you, you know, you can tell the change, for sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano grow from what was really a, a small town to a city.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, with all the, uh, Central Expressway, uh, with all the stores and the, uh, restaurants and the uh, convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime pickings for people driving by.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know and,
B:	Well, I was appalled to read the other day about the, uh, uh, shooting on the tollway.
A:	That's, that couldn't be too far from you, neither.
B:	Uh, well, it's farther west of me.
A:	Okay.
B:	I live over near White Rock Lake.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	okay.
B:	But, uh,
B:	uh, it was really frightening to, think that, uh, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway, or for those people in the tollbooth.
B:	Uh, I never thought about someone robbing those,
B:	but, apparently, they do.
A:	I don't know, uh, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it just doesn't seem possible, does it.
A:	It's kind of, kind of stupid, isn't it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time.
A:	It's, looks like easy pickings
B:	No.
A:	and away you go, right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, uh, the theft and the, the violence that we see.
A:	I think you're right, uh, although I think that may be an excuse for people, too.
B:	It, it is convenient, isn't it?
A:	Right.
B:	I didn't know what I was doing.
A:	Right.
B:	That kind.
A:	Right,
A:	just like the old alcohol idea
A:	and I think people, uh, I think when you have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, yes,
B:	and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	And, uh, uh,
A:	Where do you work?
B:	Uh, do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are?
A:	Uh, yes,
A:	I think I do.
A:	That, uh, is that Amelia Earhart, School there?
B:	Uh, no
B:	this is over near Lincoln High School. Uh, just, not far off South Central Expressway.
A:	Okay.
A:	That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?
B:	It is a pretty rough area.
B:	We're over by Fair Park.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	And, uh, you know, you watch the people.
B:	There are marvelous B M W and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns.
A:	Huh.
B:	And the kids see that
B:	and, uh, they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where, uh, you know, running for, uh, drug dealers if,
A:	Definitely that area, that, that's big time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Big time there, sure is.
B:	It surely is.
A:	I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself .
B:	Well, I'm careful.
A:	that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, uh, a little scary sometimes
B:	and, uh, I manage the,
A:	Well, credit cards
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'll tell you what, I, I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I, uh, tore mine up.
B:	Is that right?
B:	I, I know I know some other people that have done that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, I got in some problems with, uh, financial problems because of credit cards
A:	so I, uh, basically just got rid of all of them.
B:	Um.
A:	I, I have a, a couple.
A:	I have a, uh, gas card that I, that I use just for gas and you know, uh, one that I use just for emergencies
B:	Uh-huh
A:	but,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I I have, we have some, some friends that did the, exactly the same thing.
B:	They, uh, you know, they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed
B:	and finally they realized that they were, they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole
B:	and they just cut them all up except for, for one they kept for emergencies
B:	and they're still paying away to get out of debt.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know it.
B:	But, no,
B:	I did just the opposite.
B:	I, I guess I, I sort of followed in my, uh, parents' footsteps.
B:	I have quite a few of them.
B:	I use them continually,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I, uh, I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for.
B:	And, uh, and I always pay them off totally every month.
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's a, that's a good policy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it, you know, I mean, they, they're just a convenience for me.
B:	I don't have to get cash out of the bank,
B:	and I don't have to to be writing checks
B:	and and, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, sometimes I wish I had them,
A:	but in most cases, I'm glad I don't  because I, you know, unfortunately I, I, I don't have the control you have
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I wish I did,
A:	but but I don't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and it, you know, it,
A:	I just don't want to get into that situation again,
A:	so we'll,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, it, it's easy,
B:	I mean, you don't have anything transferring, just a little signature,
B:	so what, you know
A:	Oh, that's it.
A:	See, and that's,
A:	even with my gas card you know, I find that I'll go in to get some gas
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'll end up buying, you know, candy and drinks and you know, sweets and whatever,
B:	Right.
A:	and then at the end of the month I, you know, I get a bill
A:	and I'm thinking what did I get, that costs so much.
B:	Surprising.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And,
B:	Well, you know, but the,
B:	I mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,
B:	you're not going to, you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that,
B:	right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's true,
A:	but I can, I can certainly understand where
B:	Now I,
A:	You know,
B:	the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really, you know, uh, not so much discipline,
B:	I mean, well, I mean, you have sort of a discipline in general about finances,
B:	but, but I hate their, their rates so badly, I mean their interest rates so badly  that I,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Isn't it,
A:	that's unbelievable.
A:	How,
A:	let me ask you this.
A:	How, how old are you?
B:	I'm, uh, thirty-three.
A:	Thirty-three?
B:	Thirty-two,
B:	excuse me.
A:	Okay.
A:	You'll be thirty-three this year?
B:	Yeah.
A:	You want to be thirty-two as long as you can, huh.
A:	It's coming.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I know what you mean about the interest rates. It's, uh, it's unbelievable.
B:	You know, I just, that just irritates me so much that, that I refuse to pay them interest
B:	and, and my wife recently, uh, decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off
B:	and, she's from there and and, uh, didn't really have the money,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, she could pay it off,
B:	and so I, sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards,
B:	but she's paying it,
B:	and, uh, I just won't do it.
B:	I mean, she's paying, I don't know, I don't know what per month, you know, forty, fifty dollars per month in interest
A:	Oh, jeez.
B:	and I just, you know, I just refuse to give it to them.
B:	If I need to borrow that kind of money, I'll go to the bank
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then, you bet.
B:	You know.
A:	That's,
A:	uh, yeah,
A:	I, in fact, I've, I've even, uh, heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less, uh rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, uh cards and just sent them back, you know.
B:	Income.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I, I guess there's some, there's, uh, uh, some negotiating there, too,
A:	because I heard, uh,
A:	on one of the local talk shows here, they had somebody on and, and said, what you can do is, uh, call, you know,
A:	if you've got a pretty good rating, uh, credit rating you can call your you know, your, your card, wherever you got your card from and tell them, hey, either drop my rates or drop my, you know, uh annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	High,
B:	I might,
A:	You know, and if you've got, if you've got a pretty good uh, uh, history with them they're more than willing to do that.
B:	Um.
B:	Right.
B:	Um, I might try that because I, I have one card that I've had for about, uh, I don't know, nine or ten years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	in fact, that's, that's what this guy,
A:	you know, he wrote a book on it
A:	and he says that's, you know, he's tried it with several of his cards
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he's just told them, you know, I, I can get this card from this bank at this rate
A:	and yours is at, you know, eighteen or nineteen percent.
B:	Right.
A:	It does not make sense for me to do that
A:	and if you won't drop my rates, I'll just go ahead and send you back your card
A:	and I'll go somewhere else and get it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	for me the big thing, you know, is the, uh, uh, is the annual fee
B:	and I just refuse,
B:	I won't get any card now,
B:	I've, I've got a good rating
B:	and I've got, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm not going, I'm not going to pay an annual fee.
B:	The only one I actually pay on is this one that I, that, the very first,
A:	Hello.
B:	Hello.
A:	Hi,
A:	my name is Dolphene.
A:	I live in Texas.
B:	Hi,
B:	my name is Pat Johnson
B:	and I live in Texas too.
A:	Okay,
A:	I work for T I,
A:	do, do you also?
B:	No.
A:	Okay.
B:	No,
B:	I live in Dallas.
B:	I work for the Dallas school system.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	uh, you ready to begin?
B:	We might as well.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right?
A:	Yes.
B:	And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home?
A:	Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.
A:	I, I believe, if I, am in a position, uh, like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also, and uh, or have someone go into their home, you know and uh, and look after them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That way.
B:	Yes,
B:	I would find it very difficult, uh, to, uh, place my father or my step-mother uh, in a place like that. Particularly, since I know how they feel about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	it's basically, it's more how they feel about it.
B:	Yes.
A:	And it is like they feel, they are, uh, the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away You know?
B:	Yes.
B:	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for, you know, if you are faced with placing someone. In a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference.
B:	And I have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who, you know, could care for her.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about, uh, her situation.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And another thing to think about, uh, on the positive side of the nursing homes here,
A:	I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I got to see a lot of the things that they did
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they, uh, they had a lot of crafts
B:	Yes.
A:	and they had a lot of games
A:	and, uh, they, get together and just do, they they do all sorts of things
A:	and then there
A:	some, some of the, uh, the people that are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, then there are others that are,
A:	uh, it is just a job
A:	and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, the, the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts. Because there are some, uh, who poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And they may be ambulatory,
B:	but they tend to behave like children, small children
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh.
A:	Well, it is like, the one that I worked in, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,
A:	they would just roll themselves around all over the place
A:	and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities
B:	Yes.
A:	and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group
A:	and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some some, uh, I guess, uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	What, what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that
B:	Yes,
B:	Alzheimer,
B:	yes.
A:	and they don't, don't, uh, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities.
B:	Yes
B:	and that can,
A:	Okay.
A:	So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?
B:	Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.
B:	I have a set amount that I, that I save.
B:	Actually, well actually there is a, a way,
B:	budget our money apparently.
B:	The,
B:	uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks
B:	and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that
B:	and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.
A:	Right.
A:	That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I am single,
A:	so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I basically,
B:	Really don't need to.
A:	Right,
A:	I don't need to.
A:	I am the only that I have to keep track of
A:	so it makes it a little bit easier.
B:	That's right.
A:	Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are
A:	and I am pretty consistent from month to month
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,
B:	I am in my fifties now,
B:	but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,
B:	I had four kids
B:	and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.
B:	Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.
B:	Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.
B:	For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.
B:	Every six months I have to pay car insurance.
B:	Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.
B:	So I take a set amount.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in
B:	and I also have got a checking account besides that,
B:	but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out
B:	and I put it in parenthesis.
B:	I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.
B:	Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.
A:	Right.
B:	And I guess that's a way of budgeting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's,
A:	I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.
A:	I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.
A:	Like I am,
A:	probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind
A:	and I am making every effort to, to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, you know, we've got two cars.
B:	My wife has a car
B:	and I like to drive pick up truck.
B:	So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.
B:	And you know I am constantly making car payments,
B:	but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, you know, I get one paid for
B:	and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides
B:	so it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,
A:	Huh. Right.
B:	but you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying.
A:	Right.
A:	Have you thought about, uh, leasing?
B:	Well, uh, I have thought about it,
B:	but leasing wouldn't,
B:	you know, I don't use it for my business.
A:	I see.
B:	My wife uses hers just for pleasure
B:	and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away
A:	Right.
B:	so.
A:	But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess.
B:	Uh,
A:	You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you're right.
B:	Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,
B:	but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill
B:	and you got to put put stuff in them you know.
A:	That's right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	mine's, uh, seven years old
A:	and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.
A:	I had a number of expenses
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,
A:	uh, you know the,
A:	as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.
A:	So, I just went through that whole set last year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again
B:	Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.
B:	Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't, uh, kill you all in one month.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	What line of work are you in?
A:	Your turn.
B:	Oh, I, I start.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.
B:	Uh, and really, we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm, I'm paid once a month which sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions
B:	and you need to make sure all your bills are paid.
B:	Uh, about yourself?
A:	Well, I have to say I really don't have a budget.
A:	Both my wife and I, uh, grew up in, uh, families of rather modest means
A:	and, uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say.
A:	And, uh, we're both so, uh, frugal that, uh, we really don't need a budget, you know.
A:	We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well I guess that really is sort of, uh, keeping a budget,
B:	you know. You stay within your, uh  within your means.
A:	Well we stay within our means
A:	but we  don't do it, uh, by conscious effort.
A:	It just sort of happens automatically.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Although we just moved to California
A:	and, uh, the cost of living here in California is, uh, I would say rather pathological
B:	Yes
A:	Uh, housing prices are, you know, like from four to ten times more expensive than, uh, uh, they were where I came from in, uh, Dallas.
B:	Oh, you moved from Dallas to San Francisco.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh uh, that presents a, a real shock
B:	That is a hugh difference.
B:	Yeah.
A:	actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California
A:	but,
B:	But you have good sour dough
B:	and it's a beautiful place to live
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's God's country.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and one way you know that is that only God can afford it
A:	Uh, so budget is not a problem for us.
A:	Uh, at least it hasn't been.
A:	It may, may be at this point.
A:	But, uh, up until this point it really hasn't been
A:	When I, uh, was in, uh, undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that, you know, in my discipline, was like oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.
A:	And, uh, I noted at that point that I was, you know, if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever.
A:	So I stopped worrying about money.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it,
A:	never have worried about money since then.
B:	Well, that, that's a system too.
A:	Sometimes, uh, it's a bit of a, a problem, you know, because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should.
A:	But, uh, I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of, of, uh, investments
A:	but,
B:	Well then again, you know, you said you, you are able to take trips.
B:	And you do, obviously, have enough to live on
B:	so I guess you're indirectly budgeting. Uh, just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal, uh, in spending the money.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I mean that's, that's a form of budgeting I would think
B:	It's, it's kind of a strange topic to, to try to, for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money.
A:	Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then.
B:	Yeah.
A:	How big is your family?
B:	Uh, well we're, we have one on the way.
A:	I see.
B:	Uh, my wife,
B:	and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, uh, in, uh, September.
A:	So how,
A:	you, once you get ten children though, you may have,
B:	No
B:	I think it's just going to be one.
A:	Oh, all right
B:	How about yourself?
A:	I have two kids.
A:	Uh, one  nine and one thirteen
B:	Oh.
A:	and they are beginning to be a budget problem but, uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point.
B:	Do they budget at all?
B:	I mean do you have them on an allowance?
A:	I give them a, I give them an allowance
A:	and they, uh,
A:	I basically give my son ten dollars a week
A:	and I put half of it in the bank
A:	and I give, give him the other half in cold cash.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, he has a teller card so he can, uh, do what he do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank.
A:	But, at least, it isn't, you know, burning a hole in his pocket.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If he wants to use it, he has to go get it
A:	and that usually
A:	Capital punishment, uh, I guess, out in California is, has had a lot of, uh, a lot of, you know, discourse in the paper.
A:	Uh, apparently, you know, there's, they haven't, uh, executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, I believe.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	That's, that's as far back as I can remember
B:	Well, that's before  my time actually.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they,
A:	Well, I, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in Redwood City when we were out there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community.
A:	But the, uh, I, I really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars
A:	and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together
A:	and they, uh, they, I think, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. Uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.
A:	Uh, and I, I think that, uh, that there's something that has to be changed in the system to, to do that.
A:	I think capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough
A:	but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?
B:	Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,
B:	it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself.
B:	It's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're going on death row
B:	but you'll stay there for twenty years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And nothing is being done about it.
B:	Uh, the laws exist and are frequently upheld in, in, uh, in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find.
B:	And it's, it's really getting out of hand in many states.
A:	Well, the term technicality .
A:	The law enforcement community, uh, uh, you know, has to, has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which, uh, grievous acts are done to, uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going to be guilty of, of a crime.
A:	Or whether, uh, and whether the rights of that individual are been, have been, you know, impuned.
A:	Uh, but or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it
A:	but, but, you know, the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know, the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive.
A:	Now, I, I'm, at this juncture
A:	I, you know, I'm, I'm not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a technicality.
A:	You know, that, that's what all these, these hearings are about
A:	and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about.
A:	I mean our, uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of, out of the can
A:	and, uh, you know, he, he tried to appeal his conviction. Uh,
A:	and, you know, it didn't work.
A:	But be that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry.
A:	Uh, in, in the old days, you know, and say round about times of battle of Hastings, you know, and the villages if you were a transgressor, they, they either, you know, drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody
A:	and he, you were his slave.
A:	And if he didn't like what you did, he killed you.
A:	And that has, that's pretty effective.
A:	Uh, you know, it's not good for civil rights, I guess,
A:	but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got to get along in the community
A:	and if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods.
A:	So, I, I, I mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh, imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by, uh, civilian authority in, in in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing.
B:	Well, it seems like well it, it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished,
B:	and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off.
B:	Um, for instance, um there's a case a few years back where, uh, someone, uh, someone who's being convicted for, was under a was going to trial for murder, was let off because of a technicality in that. The the arresting officer, uh, did not read the defendant their rights.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And where his, old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, the, everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
A:	Uh, a lot of companies now are, are using, uh, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the either, uh, elementary or intermediate or advanced, uh, drug users.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I know the, the government is, uh, you know, gives drug tests to all new entrants, all new applicants coming into government.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and I quite frankly, don't see anything wrong with it.
A:	I, I'm, I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian.
A:	And, and I, I feel as though, uh, that, uh, uh, you know, that if you, you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background.
A:	Of course, we're, we're,
A:	being involved in my organization, uh, we, we have deep background checks
A:	and  and so, uh, but, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can, can escape that.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure.
A:	And, uh, I have absolutely no compunction about, uh, using any and all means to, to, uh, uh, you know, work out, figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and, uh, and putting that guy into, into therapy to, whatever it is to, to, you know, break this, uh, activity.
B:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs
A:	and there isn't anything
A:	but getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope
B:	Yeah.
A:	What's your, uh, feeling?
B:	Uh, well I guess I, I guess I'm probably a little more to, toward the other direction.
B:	Uh, well I guess, mainly because, uh, it's, I, well,
B:	like there's two sides to it I guess.
B:	Uh, one is that, uh, if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug, alcohol, whatever, or, you know, even if it's smoking, inhibits, you know, your ability to function, then I, I think that, that, you know, I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual, you know, on the spot.
B:	Uh, but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business.
B:	Uh, and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that, uh, things like drug laws seem to come and go.
B:	You know, we had prohibition for awhile
B:	and then we didn't have prohibition.
B:	Uh, you know, we've had, I guess, laws against, uh, you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Maybe a little longer.
A:	Well I think, uh, the the laws on, uh, uh, uh, the first morphine laws were, were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, eighty years or so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, so I,
B:	you know, it's, it's hard to, I guess, for me to justify what seems like, you know, basically a breach of the First you know, freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that may or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years from now or even twenty or ten,
B:	who knows.
A:	Well, the thing of it is the, the,  that, that is, uh, uh, in, in many respects, uh, uh, you know, just, just, I think, an over simplification.
B:	I mean, prohibition certainly didn't last.
A:	I, I think there, there's so much criminal activity, uh, that people go into to, to support drug habits.
B:	Well, but you got to look at prohibition though.
B:	You had the same problems there, right?
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know, they, they support drug habits with, uh, with, uh, you know, with things like, uh, you know, burglary or, or prostitution or stuff like that,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well it goes back to that, again,
B:	if you look at prohibition. I mean because it's illegal, it costs more.
B:	If it was legal,
B:	I mean, face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.
A:	I, I I must admit that,
B:	And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is, you know, snort your brains out all day long, if it was legal, you could do it real cheap
B:	and, you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, yeah,
B:	get, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I must admit that the production costs of, of these drugs are, are zippo compared to the street market costs and, and the costs to society,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	well that's why there's, you know, people dealing it because there's money in it, you know.
B:	There's ridiculous amounts of money.
A:	But I, I, I, I think that, that the, that, you know, the, being in law enforcement, you know, they, I, I probably have a kind of a draconian, Philistine attitude toward it.
A:	And, but, but the, uh, uh, I, I really feel as though the interdiction effort is, is,
A:	as soon as you, you get rid of one goon that's, that's, that's involved in drugs and
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	interdiction's hopeless.
B:	I mean
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then another, another one will jump up.
B:	there's no way you're ever going to win that.
A:	But we, we see,
B:	The tighter you squeeze, the more the price goes up, the more incentive there is.
B:	I mean that's a losing fight .
A:	Yeah.
A:	as soon as we wind up, uh, uh, you know, for,
A:	well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand
A:	but, but people  want to, get, get stoned
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and I, I don't see that,
B:	Well, yeah.
B:	It goes back to, you know, what right, what can society impose on people.
B:	I mean, can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't think you can.
B:	I mean, you know, I'm, you know, was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic
B:	so, you know, I'm one of these, you know, ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty hour a day type people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, you know, yeah,
B:	I can really relate to
B:	yeah,
B:	everybody ought to do their own share,
B:	you know. I don't have any, you know, love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, you know,
A:	See, when you're with a big company or a big organization, a lot of times, uh, you know, the benefits are good
A:	and, and, you know, the pay is regular
A:	but, uh, you know, sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on.
A:	And I, I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that, that, uh, that anybody could get in, in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you, you get to know what's going on.
A:	And maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to, to do.
A:	What's, what's your feeling about benefits?
A:	What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company.
B:	Well, since I'm kind of on the, the older side, you know, I, I, I just feel like, uh, when I start talking about benefits, I talk about, I'm concerned about medical benefits
B:	Uh, my, uh, my husband works for McDonald Douglas
B:	and so his benefits, his medical benefits are so excellent, you know,
B:	that's really great.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I work for, uh, a bank, Western Financial.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they don't let me know really about anything that's going on.
B:	Even some of the immediate things that I need to know, I don't know it until the next hour
B:	and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made.
B:	We're changing departments.
B:	We're changing policies.
B:	We're changing doing other kinds of things. Which to me is, is disturbing
B:	I mean, I feel like if, I, I don't necessarily need to, uh, be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level,
B:	you are, you are right there.
B:	You know, I'm pretty much on a low level as far as, uh, the company is concerned.
B:	But I, I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening
B:	and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if, if I  had a little bit more information along that line.
A:	Well,
A:	I   I well I work for the government
A:	and, uh, actually I work for the F B I.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	And, uh, and so, you know, we, we don't, there's lots of things that we don't get told. For good reason.
A:	But, uh, but basically, uh, there's lots of things that, that we should know about projects.
A:	I'm an engineer. You know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm, I'm a COTR.
A:	And
A:	and I, I worked in the same lab with a guy
A:	and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years.
A:	And we should have,
A:	you know, we're, we're now collaborating.
B:	Oh.
A:	And
B:	And it, it ,
A:	for two years we didn't. And, we, which was a, kind of stupid.
A:	But, uh, but our organization is doing something else on Monday.
A:	Uh, we're having a, for all unclassified programs, we're, we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways
A:	and every, all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do. Which I thought was kind of interesting and, But, uh, but that, that sort, sort of thing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is interesting.
A:	But, if you, I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on.
B:	Exactly.
A:	And, and, but of course most time, most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know.
A:	And, you know, if you don't really count. If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months.
A:	Or you might, you know, if it doesn't impact you directly. Or if your management doesn't think that.
A:	But, but regard to benefits. You know, most companies have, most big organizations have decent, you know, benefits like retirement and that sort of thing.
A:	In the private sector I would think that one of the major, uh, situations, especially when you reach, you know, the, the mid-fifties, is keeping a job until you retire.
B:	right.
A:	And engineers are, uh, are baggage to most, uh, uh, as they get older, to, to most companies.
A:	And, uh, it's very much like the military,
A:	it windows out.
A:	You know, you, you think well, boy, I'm getting more money
A:	and I'm getting more responsibility,
A:	I'm doing this.
A:	But as you climb up that tree, pretty soon you're, the, the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and pretty soon somebody falls off.
A:	I, I've fallen off twice in the private sector.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, and, you know, I can get up,
B:	I know.
B:	It, it seems to be, be kind of, kind of scary, you know. Because you think of,
B:	uh, see my son's eighteen right now
B:	and he, he's, uh, he wants to go into engineering.
B:	And the, the, the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open
B:	and he's interested in, basically, three different areas.
B:	But, uh, it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that.
B:	He needs to do his own course of investigation and, and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical.
B:	I mean, my, uh, brother-in-law is like, uh, I mean he's sixty.
B:	He's not ready to retire
B:	but his company is, is, uh, is, uh, closing up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff. And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he, what he was working on. He's getting cut back
B:	and he's not ready to retire
A:	Yeah,
A:	he may be retired.
A:	Budgeting activity in our household I, has is, uh, uh, kind of an informal kind of situation.
A:	We, we, you know, put,
A:	actually what happens is, uh, is, my check gets automatically deposited.
A:	I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore.
A:	It just gets deposited.
A:	And,  and, and my, my wife, you know, you know, looks at all those bills that come in
A:	and, you know, and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. You see,
A:	and so our, our budgeting,
A:	we really don't have a formal budgeting situation.
A:	Every time I've ever tried one, it's, uh, I've just got wrapped in my inertia.
A:	And, uh, I've just decided not to pursue it.
A:	Uh, what, what's your budget situation?
B:	Well, actually, uh, I've, I've had a couple of different situations.
B:	My current one has been the most successful.
B:	Uh, at a certain point in life
B:	my husband, my ex-husband was an alcoholic.
B:	And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies
B:	and that left me with three teenagers.
A:	You know, well actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it?
B:	It certainly is
B:	But at any rate, what happened was that I, I just absolutely put away all the credit cards.
B:	I didn't rip them up.
B:	I didn't send them back.
B:	Nothing.
B:	I just put them away.
B:	Because there was one that it was really handy to have.
B:	If I absolutely had to have something, I could go use it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had.
B:	And if we didn't have it, we absolutely didn't spend it.
B:	But then, as things improved, you know.
B:	Once, once I got them all through college, uh, it came to the point where, uh,
B:	my parents came through the depression.
B:	I'm not sure how old you are.
A:	Well, my, you know, my, my parents too.
A:	You, you  you were born in, in the, in the late thirties or early forties.
B:	But my,
B:	Late thirties,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house.
B:	And that's kind of the way I was raised.
B:	And so I'm not a very demanding person in, in that aspect.
B:	So for quite a period of time, I just flat didn't spend any money.
A:	Um.
B:	Now, meanwhile, I got, had a, a building bank balance.
B:	And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have, I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that, that's good.
B:	And that, that's the way I've operated ever since then.
B:	It,
B:	and you know, if, if something goes on sale and I don't have the money, I still don't buy it.
A:	Well, we, we buy what, well,
A:	we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator, a new ceramic top stove, and a new dishwasher.
B:	Oh my
A:	And, and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was, was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
B:	Oh my!
A:	and you know.
B:	Oh my.
A:	Right.
A:	I mean, we just, we got a monster, you know, bill coming in.
A:	But, but we also have zero interest being paid.
A:	And we pay it off as, as it goes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's the way I do my credit cards now.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So we never really get that much over, uh, over extended.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards.
A:	Huh.
B:	But it's the fact that I have enough of a, of a cushion in the bank so that when they come, I can pay them in full.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We're, we're doing that.
A:	We have, you know, uh,
A:	this is our, our, our big, uh,
A:	we did redecorating.
A:	Two, you know, two new pieces in the in the family room and new carpet.
A:	I mean we just  uh, we've just been spending, spending, spending.
B:	Oh my.
B:	I'm envious
B:	Well I,
A:	but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've, we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we're, you know, we don't have that.
B:	It's time for you to do these things then. Right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, uh, it's about time that we did that.
A:	and it all looks still pretty good to me.
A:	Why, why we need to replace it?
A:	But, but, unfortunately my, my, my wife really feels as though it's, it's just been an inappropriate, uh, thing to, to, I mean
A:	that rug is thirteen years old,
A:	why not replace it.
A:	I mean, uh, I say it might go for another thirteen
A:	but, uh, too late, we'll never find that out.
B:	This is so funny.
B:	That's wonderful.
B:	But  you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money, you need somebody to help you spend it.
A:	And,
B:	I mean, certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should, be or not
A:	You know, I, I, I don't spend that much money.
A:	I just, uh, we just sort of have had, uh, you know, too many obligations to, you know,
A:	we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they, they got through school.
A:	And that was the major, you know, decade of expenses, you know.
A:	So we, we feel as, uh,
A:	but as far as any formal budgeting, uh, you know, I, I, we just apparently have been very fortunate.
A:	When we went, want to go out to eat, we go out to eat.
A:	We never really, you know, have to program money for that or make choices, you know.
A:	But, uh, we don't have that uproarious a, a lifestyle.
A:	After all, we're,
A:	Okay, um.
A:	How has it been this week for you?
B:	Weather-wise, or otherwise?
A:	Weather-wise.
B:	Weather-wise.
B:	Damp, cold, warm
A:	Oh, no,
A:	damp.
B:	We have, we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, uh, in the last week.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.
A:	My goodness.
A:	Well, I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then.
A:	It was ninety-six yesterday,
B:	I heard about that.
A:	and we set a record yesterday. And, uh, very windy,
A:	but then today the wind has dropped off, and also, the temperature, so, very cool, uh,
A:	I think right now it's like sixty-nine,
B:	Um
A:	and that's cool for
A:	or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very pleasant,
A:	no rain in the last month, I don't think.
A:	The ground's very dry
A:	and our yard work, everything is in bloom,
A:	so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry,
A:	but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies,
A:	we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Everything blooming,
A:	and, and the weather.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,
A:	so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh, and golfing, reasons and things like that.
B:	The blue flu,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah,
B:	the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work, I guess.
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh, we have had, uh, as I've said, we have had variable weather. Uh,
A:	Um.
B:	It has been untypically wet for this time of year,
A:	Um.
B:	and, also, we have a lot of green, you know,
B:	the grass has been growing
B:	and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn, if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, or something along those lines,
A:	Uh.
B:	but fortunately it rains
B:	and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring,
B:	and, well I guess we're still in winter,
B:	and, uh, we have had no snow.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No snow?
B:	To speak of, to speak of.
A:	Um.
B:	We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter
B:	and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches total accumulation.
A:	Um.
B:	So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.
A:	Um.
B:	So, uh, in that regard, it's fine,
B:	but, uh, I envy you your ninety-four degrees.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes
A:	it is.
A:	Down in the more southern and western areas.
A:	And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and, uh, very windy.
A:	It's amazing to me
A:	because I have only lived in Dallas for three years,
A:	and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time.
A:	It does,
A:	I, I
A:	very seldom, if any,
A:	I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana. In the flatlands,
B:	and it was that way every day.
A:	Um.
B:	Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter,
A:	Um.
B:	so, that, uh,
B:	you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, otherwise as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, where did you go to school in Indiana?
B:	Purdue.
A:	Purdue.
A:	I have a brother that lives in, uh, uh, South Bend, Indiana.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	And, I had to always,
A:	I've lived there for eight years myself.
A:	I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.
A:	But, I didn't. Uh.
B:	Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell.
A:	No,
A:	originally I'm from New Mexico.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I was born in New Mexico
A:	and we lived in, uh, South Bend for eighty, eight years, and, uh, then moved to, uh, Tennessee actually.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.
A:	Very much,
A:	very much,
A:	cause I, I spent thirteen years there. And, uh, then moved to Dallas about three years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Gee,
B:	you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have
A:	Yeah, uh,
A:	my father was in the Air Force,
A:	so,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I worked for the government,
B:	so I, I moved, uh, much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, I guess the, uh, this is my first conversation in this, uh, uh, series.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	I, I received a call last night because of the, uh,
B:	I had not received my, uh, personal identification number.
A:	Right.
B:	So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I, I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.
A:	Yeah
B:	So, uh, is there any,
B:	I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk.
A:	It's, um, it's just as long as you want to.
B:	Oh.
A:	I mean it's just, uh, as long as you want to, and just, you know, a reasonable lengthy conversation.
A:	Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments?
B:	No,
B:	I do not.
B:	I work for G T E.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And, I, uh, of course, was, I was sent a, uh, an application from, uh, from Jack.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've known Jack for some time.
B:	I'm in the speech processing business, and have been for a number of years,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	so I was very much interested, in, in being a speaker for this
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments,
A:	and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an environmental engineer,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	and, uh, they just published this internally, you know, getting people involved.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, that, that's really strange.
A:	I, I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though.
A:	I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland
A:	or,
B:	I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, but I have, uh, I have been a speaker in other, uh, similar type of activities.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,
B:	so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We haven't talked much about the weather
A:	Oh, well.
B:	I know that's what we're supposed to do.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, really it, uh, the letter just says, um,
A:	let's see, I can't,
A:	I was looking at it,
A:	I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,
A:	and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed.
A:	So.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	In environmental engineering, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, the work place environment
B:	or,
A:	Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	Taking, taking care of uh,
A:	I'm actually in the air division,
A:	and we monitor, um, anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a building,
A:	or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the work place
A:	and we take care of that,
A:	but , within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water, uh, solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I had
B:	my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about, uh, concerning recycling in the community.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	The call I received,
B:	and so, I had, uh, I had thought a little bit about it, um, before hand.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	So, I,
B:	but that, that's interesting.
B:	I have a, uh, uh, friend who is a planner. Uh, a city planner.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And, one of his,
B:	and he models, uh, city districts, and so forth, uh, does computer modeling.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, one of the, uh,
B:	he has inputs, or gets inputs from, uh, an environmental engineer. .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we actually, our division is corporate wide,
A:	and we take care of just the Dallas area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course we have several plants here,
A:	but, um, we do air modeling also.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area.
A:	What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction,
A:	and, uh, we have a huge chemical data base.
B:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	And, uh, our, our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site
A:	and, and, um, its concentration,
A:	and if, if anything ever happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.
A:	Okay, um, well,
B:	just a couple.
A:	What do you have
B:	Uh, I've got an Omega
B:	and I've got a, uh, generic three eighty, or four eighty-six machine.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's very, very generic.
A:	What did you do, put it together?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
B:	and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine
A:	Well, that's,
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's all I got to say for it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What do you use it for?
B:	Huh?
A:	What do you use it for?
B:	Uh, work,
B:	uh, I'm a contract programmer.
A:	Oh, yeah?
A:	What kind of programs do you,
B:	Uh, anything
A:	Okay,
A:	I mean like business programs
A:	or, Man.
B:	Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment
B:	and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens.
B:	It was kind of fun.
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well, that's,
A:	Well, that sounds interesting.
A:	Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	definitely.
A:	That's where the speed helps out.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six.
B:	It's like slow out the
A:	Yep,
A:	that will, that will, slow you up
B:	Huh?
A:	Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, really need a faster system.
A:	Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.
A:	Who is that?
B:	Uh, his name is T Q or something like that.
B:	And my notebook is somewhere around here
B:	See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough.
A:	I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one
B:	Uh, he's, uh, up in,
B:	Huh?
A:	That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them.
A:	They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
B:	Oh, that works.
A:	that's why I have so many different levels of P C around at the moment.
B:	Uh, here it is.
B:	A T S Computers.
A:	A T S?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And where are they at?
B:	Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Okay,
B:	he's, uh, uh, south of Renner on, on Custer.
B:	And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center.
A:	In Richardson there.
B:	Huh?
A:	In Richardson?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know where you mean.
A:	There is a Mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner,
A:	that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.
B:	Right,
B:	it's, it's, it's just south of there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's a little place, looks like a castle.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Kind of, uh, little guy in there.
B:	He, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.
A:	Oh.
B:	Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
A:	Really?
A:	Well, that's a good deal.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was pretty reasonable.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, uh, he,
B:	and he does a good job
B:	and he, he, he, uh, guarantees everything he sells.
A:	Uh, there is a lot,
A:	you ever go by Lucky Computer there?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	I used to,
A:	when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so.
A:	So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days.
A:	But I, ,
B:	Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.
A:	I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	oh, yeah,
B:	I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in,
B:	you know, it's like, wow
A:	Yeah.
B:	That works,
B:	I'll go do that
A:	I,
B:	And boy that thing screams now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six.
A:	That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
A:	Is that right?
A:	That's it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Huh, well,
A:	you've done.
B:	Our most recent series of projects I guess, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.
A:	Well, how did it go?
B:	Well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another,
B:	and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain.  Which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over.
A:	Gee, like starting over, I guess.
A:	Uh.
B:	It wasn't one of those,
B:	it started out as a Sunday project
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and by, by the next Sunday it was done.
B:	It wasn't a one dayer.
B:	Believe me.
A:	Boy, that sounds like, uh,
A:	course, uh, I don't know,
A:	once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's good for another thirty years.
A:	Um, you've got an older house?
B:	Yes.
A:	They are built a little bit more sturdy than
B:	Well, that's the thing that surprised me, because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper,
A:	Right.
B:	and it was all soldered.
A:	Oh, is that right.
B:	That's what drove me bananas, because, you know, I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together
A:	Yes.
B:	and nothing wanted to go,
B:	so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over.
A:	And just start at square one.
B:	Really.
A:	Uh.
B:	That was an all day job, just to get it plumbed.
A:	Well, and then if you do it wrong
B:	Fortunately, I was very fortunate, uh, in the fact that, uh, when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on  nothing leaked,
A:	Everything went all right.
B:	everything worked.
B:	And I just said, that's marvelous.
B:	I appreciate it.
A:	That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens.
B:	Well, I expected something to leak, you know left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right.
B:	But it all came together,
B:	so I, I felt pretty fortunate about that.
A:	All worked out all right, huh.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, um, well probably the last thing I did was, uh, paint and wallpaper kids room
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I learned to,
A:	I used the wrong kind of paint.
A:	This wasn't, must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.
B:	What kind of paint?
A:	It was a latex paint, paint,
A:	it was flat
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss.
A:	Uh, but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens, and things like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, and semigloss for trim work, and usually flat for walls.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I think maybe, uh,
A:	I don't know if it was just the.
B:	Was it not washable paint?
A:	Well, it, it is a latex paint,
A:	but it just kind of is, is,
A:	so, you know, so it's supposed to wash, you're supposed to be able to wash it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it, um, just looks dingy.
A:	I don't know how else to explain it.
B:	What color is it?
A:	It's pink.
B:	Pink,
B:	okay.
A:	It's kind of got, uh, oh, just kind of a worn look to it.
A:	I don't know even how to say,
A:	just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked
A:	but,
B:	Did you, uh, require more than one can of paint?
A:	I, we put two coats on it,
A:	and it's a small room,
A:	but I think it only took one, uh, can.
B:	You didn't have to mix paint then, right.
A:	No.
B:	Okay.
A:	We did, uh, oh,
A:	you do mix the color as far as you start with, uh, white
A:	and then they add the color.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know what I'm saying
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	But you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right.
A:	And then I wall papered a couple of walls,
A:	and, uh.
B:	How'd that go?
A:	Well, that was the first time I've ever wallpapered,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Kind of fun, isn't it.
A:	That's an education in itself.
B:	Really.
A:	But, uh, the dye lots, uh, must have been a little bit different from,
A:	first of all it takes quite a few rolls, even a small room, if you're trying to match a design.
B:	Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you, when you buy your paper.
A:	Yes.
A:	That's what I needed,
A:	and I didn't think about that.
A:	I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so a lot is wasted.
B:	Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats.
A:	So you know how.
A:	See, I didn't even think to look for that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then the,
A:	one of them was just a different color, different color pink, is what it ended up being.
B:	Um.
A:	And .
B:	When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?
A:	No
A:	I didn't.
B:	Or did you start at the edge?
A:	Is that how you're supposed to do?
A:	I started at one edge and went over,
A:	then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh,
B:	I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall,
B:	and I'll start with a plumb line. And start in the middle of the wall, and, and go from there, and go all the way around the room.
A:	And start right there.
A:	Do you seem to get it straighter,
A:	is that the advantage,
A:	or what's the,
B:	Well, you, you,
A:	Do you have any children?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have two, two boys, twelve and sixteen.
A:	Twelve and sixteen.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	how about you?
A:	Well, I have three,
A:	and, uh, they're five and three and nineteen months.
B:	Oh.
A:	So we kind of got different ball game
A:	but, uh.
B:	Right
A:	What, uh,
A:	do you feel like you have any time, to spend with them?
B:	Well.
A:	They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents.
B:	That's true
B:	You actually, of course, spend less time with them when they get older,
B:	but it's, of course, still really important.
A:	Right.
B:	I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen year old.
B:	Um, I work two nights a week at a,
B:	I'm a librarian
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library.
B:	They keep it open, you know, for kids to do their work
A:	Right.
B:	and he, um, and then they, the school district hires an aide, you know, to work for me.
A:	Sure.
B:	Well, my son is my aide.
A:	Oh, well, that's nice.
B:	So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together
A:	You're stuck together.
B:	and there's usually not very much business.
A:	No.
B:	I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet.
B:	So.
A:	I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.
B:	So we, I have sort of a captive audience,
B:	so I really do spend probably more time with him than, than most, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.
B:	But his dad's at home pretty much that time.
A:	And so that kind of gives him, uh, time with his dad, then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	yeah.
A:	Gives him a little bit of that individual time.
B:	But, but it is hard, once they get that age,
B:	I mean, their friends are the most important thing there is.
A:	Right,
A:	and they want to be able to spend, uh.
B:	That's right.
A:	Well, I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year,
A:	and every day that she's not at school, uh, she thinks we need to have someone over and play
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and that kind of
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's kind of hard.
A:	yeah,
A:	it's hard,
A:	I think, uh, I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm more worried about, Oh,
A:	I didn't this done,
A:	I didn't get,
A:	the kitchen needs to be cleaned
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	this needs to be done,
A:	and and I need to remind myself to slow down
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it'll still be there tomorrow.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	But that's kind of hard to do, you know.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is hard to do,
B:	right,
B:	yeah.
A:	You don't see yourself getting.
B:	Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, you know, organized or neat
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or, you know
A:	Right.
B:	then I think it, it is hard.
B:	It's, um,
B:	I think one of the nice things about holidays is that, you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah, with family.
A:	Slow down a little bit.
B:	We have, we often go to Illinois for Christmas,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and we're not this year,
B:	and it's just really nice because we can do, you know, the things you want to do.
A:	You can do, uh, more than than when you travel.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	This is the first year we're staying home, too,
A:	and, uh, I think it's going to be real quiet
A:	but, uh, that's an opportunity to get out the games
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	See, we usually do that,
B:	my, my kids even have already gotten out, um,
B:	my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer
A:	Right.
A:	Of of course.
B:	but, you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind,
B:	you know, and he wants to be an engineer,
B:	so he still likes all that kind of building stuff
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, um, we have the train,
B:	and we haven't had that Lego train together for years,
B:	and, um, so he sat down,
B:	and I told him I really wanted him to build the train,
B:	and we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together,
B:	I wouldn't take it apart
A:	Wouldn't take it apart after that.
B:	yeah,
B:	and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.
A:	That'd be kind of fun.
B:	And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,
B:	and, um, then his sixteen year old brother started helping, too, you know.
B:	you know, these are kind of things like during the normal rat race
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	those kinds of things never happen
A:	No
B:	but.
A:	no.
A:	In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V
A:	and
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family,
B:	Yes,
B:	yeah.
B:	Which is,
A:	usually people are not sitting in front of that.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare at it, you know, they're totally turned off to everything else.
B:	The rest of.
A:	Yes,
A:	and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?
B:	No
B:	That's right.
A:	Whereas, uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, well,
A:	I shouldn't say I could not,
A:	but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	me too.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Because they talk so much,
A:	isn't that the,
B:	they talk about T V shows,
B:	and I, huh,
B:	you know, how can you watch that, you know
A:	You're kind of like, what are you talking about
A:	and, uh,
B:	it's the best show on,
B:	I don't know.
A:	You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.
A:	They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's,
B:	Okay,
B:	all set, then.
B:	Uh, what do you think about it?
A:	Uh, I think it's a real good concept.
A:	Uh, drug testing procedures would have to be refined.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	From what I've seen on the news there's a, a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy, poor procedure in, uh, drug testing.
B:	Oh, I didn't realize that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their, in their, uh, test,
A:	but they didn't know for sure what it was,
A:	but it was a drug,
A:	so they got turned down
A:	and, uh, turns out it was a prescription. Or people getting somebody else's blood test.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like AIDS tests and such.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's right,
B:	I have heard,
B:	uh, I don't remember what they call it, sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word they use when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs,
B:	but there's not really, there weren't really any there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, every now and then there's an error
B:	and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I work here at Texas Instruments
B:	so, uh, we, we do a, let me think, do we, yeah, everyone coming in.
B:	I guess I did three years ago.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Everyone coming in, uh, goes through the drug testing procedure
B:	and they talk about it as a, you know, as, as better for the country and better for the working conditions.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So if they, uh, they test for drugs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I'm, I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore.
B:	I know we did in the military,
B:	but I don't know if once your in they continue to do it,
A:	Yeah
B:	but I guess you're always on call for it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and about a year and a half ago they instituted a, uh, a, uh, drug testing program, uh, well drug and alcohol testing program.
A:	It's, it's not a random
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	through the
A:	it,
A:	as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a, a blood test Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I think the big problem, though, is, is they send these off to large labs
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
A:	and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that, uh, going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up, things like that.
B:	So your big beef with it is the, uh,
A:	It's .
B:	Is, is, it's a good idea,
B:	but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I, I tend to agree with you David.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my brother, uh, brother used to work for Wal-Mart
B:	and then, I don't know if he still does or what because I don't know if Sam's is actually part of it,
B:	but he, you know is working at Sam's now.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Sam's is part of Wal-Mart.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah,
B:	then he's been working for the company for a while, too.
B:	He, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Good company, uh,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You all, uh, have some,
B:	he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that,
A:	Company's, that was a great place to work.
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's good news
A:	Yeah,
A:	they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock
A:	and you have a, have a little taken out of your check each, each payday to put against, uh, uh, stock portfolio. Uh, not portfolio, just, you know, against Wal-Mart stock.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what my brother was telling me.
B:	That's good, good good deal.
B:	Well, uh, how long were we
B:	I haven't done this in a couple months.
B:	How long were we supposed to discuss for?
A:	Uh, you're supposed to get five minutes.
B:	Okay,
B:	we got a couple more minutes then, I guess
B:	Uh, think what else I can say about that. Uh,
A:	Uh, do you have any idea, uh,
A:	let's see,
A:	you were, you were tested for drugs as you got into T, as, as you got into T I?
B:	Right,
B:	uh, everyone coming in gets, goes through the drug test.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, now, uh, were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
A:	or,
B:	Uh, no,
B:	well, let me think about that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was after, I I had already been hired. Uh,
A:	Okay
B:	Yeah,
B:	you get hired, then you come in the first,
B:	I,
B:	seems to me I remember that, uh, I was hired, came in and went through some orientation
B:	and I thought I,
B:	boy, I can't remember.
B:	That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test.
B:	Maybe it was during the interview.
B:	I came up a couple times for an interview,
B:	so it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened.
B:	But, uh, I guess, just like other companies, other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around,
B:	it's, it's before.
B:	They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment,
B:	so I'm sure that happened to me, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What, what about, oh,
B:	they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart
A:	Yeah.
B:	so,
A:	They, they, it was after I was already working there
A:	and they weren't testing any of those who were already working.
B:	Right.
A:	So,
A:	Okay,
A:	now then you heard the question,
A:	what  what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I'll tell you, I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on, than I do now.
A:	Okay.
B:	I do, uh, I do the easy stuff now.
B:	I change oil,
B:	uh, and then what some people would consider a little more difficult, I, I'll change spark plugs
B:	and I'll change, you know, points and, you, you know, do air filters, that kind of stuff.
A:	Um.
A:	Well.
B:	But, uh, I can't do as much as I used to,
B:	um, I used to do a whole lot more, but not any more,
B:	they're just too weird to work on now.
A:	Is that the reason you're not doing it,
A:	or are you so busy you don't have time to do it?
B:	Well, that's part of it
A:	Uh.
B:	yeah,
B:	part of it is, like you said, I don't have time.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well being a female and being alone, you, I don't do anything but put gasoline, in my car, and let someone else check the oil even.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, have you had any major repairs recently?
B:	Well, um, on this car I've got now, no,
B:	but I had a van before,
B:	and it was only two years old,
B:	and it had transmission go out on it.
A:	Oh.
B:	But fortunately that was covered under the warranty.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, you should be, feel very fortunate.
A:	I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile
B:	Um.
A:	and I'll declare, that's an expensive.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Maybe I should have just traded the car in.
B:	Yeah,
B:	sometimes it makes you wonder.
A:	Oh, it just,
A:	well, I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, um, anyway, I have a new transmission,
A:	and I'm sure that any of them would have cost or charged me almost the same amount.
A:	But
B:	Yeah.
A:	it hurts, it hurts real bad.
B:	Did you take it to a dealership?
A:	No,
A:	I took it to an independent out in Garland.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	I had, um,
A:	these people were recommended by a neighbor
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, that's the only thing,
A:	I am not a native of Dallas.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	So that means I have to depend on, on trustworthy friends
B:	Right.
A:	and that's.
A:	Anyway, it's fixed,
A:	it's running,
A:	and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's going to run for a for a while yet.
A:	Oh, I know it.
A:	It certainly is frightening.
A:	What work are you in?
B:	Uh, I, I work for T I.
A:	Oh.
B:	I, I work in the networking area.
A:	Okay,
A:	okay.
B:	Do you work for T I?
A:	No.
B:	No,
B:	okay.
A:	No,
A:	I have just retired from, um, the Southwest Medical Center.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah, where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car,
A:	but they're all too busy.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I have to do it the other way,
A:	and that's find someone and pay them to do it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I'm, I'm planning on it.
B:	Oh, it can't be any worse than last year,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Oh, it could be,
A:	but I don't much think so
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	I'm, well, we're starting out a new one,
A:	so let's make it a good one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm going to try and plan on it.
A:	Okay.
B:	All right, well, I enjoyed the conversation.
A:	Thank you.
B:	All right, thank you.
A:	Bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Okay,
B:	what, um,
B:	do you watch much T V
B:	or, you know.
A:	Um, no,
A:	I don't watch much T V.
A:	Sometimes, um, usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news.
B:	The news,
B:	yeah.
A:	But I don't think of that every day, even.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I think I get most of my current events,
A:	well, I get them from everywhere.
A:	I sometimes watch T V if I,
A:	I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day.
A:	We don't get a paper
A:	but I work, um, at a,
A:	I teach a college class
A:	and, uh
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	there's a,
A:	the library has a paper.
A:	And so I often drop in on a break and and read it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I, I figure if there's big, big news, I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or, someone else, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Now I also,
B:	I get it from all over.
B:	I watch the news every day,
B:	and I we have a news,
B:	you know, we get the newspaper, and, uh um, magazines, anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I'm,
B:	I read a lot,
B:	so I get,
B:	um, you know, I'm, I'm really up on, uh, current affairs.
B:	I get, you know the news and, and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what's your favorite news,
A:	do you get a news magazine
A:	or,
B:	Um, well, I'm not getting
B:	no,
B:	I'm not getting any news magazines
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, you know, as, as I said, I do,
B:	it's, uh, it's easy to keep up on current you know on you know, especially when you, um you know, you get a paper every day.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've got.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	And, uh.
A:	Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage?
B:	Uh, I don't know
B:	Is there anything missing?
B:	I, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's kind of hard to know.
B:	And I don't know, you know, what, what's, I mean, what are we supposed to, uh, compare it to you know, I mean, the quality, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	whatever they tell you,
B:	you know, I, uh, I guess I, I, you know, I'm satisfied.
B:	I mean, I,
B:	uh, you know, they, they're supposedly covering everything that happens,
B:	so
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	you know.
A:	Well, I do feel like, a little bit like,
A:	being from California and wanting to hear like
A:	I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something,
A:	and
B:	Oh, really?
A:	I don't ever hear it in the news here.
B:	Oh.
A:	Um.
B:	Well, uh, sometimes it's such a,
B:	you know, it's, it's so, um, slight, you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But most of the the times I find that even if there are, you know, they do have like tremors out there, you know, there'll be a small article in the paper about it.
A:	Yeah
B:	But, uh.
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I sometimes feel like, um, the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS, um, the top headlines are always a murder, you know.
B:	Oh, well.  That's what sells papers.
A:	That  that's because there's a high crime rate.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's, um, that's been like that since they, the first newspaper, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm sure.
B:	You know, but, um, I don't know.
B:	I, I guess I'm satisfied,
B:	I don't, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, what basis, you know, of comparison do we have really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	really.
B:	We don't get a, you know.
A:	That's true.
A:	We certainly get enough coverage.
A:	I mean, we, we can get news,
A:	you know, I mean, there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I was going to.
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah.
B:	Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad
A:	Yeah
B:	It's all so negative, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	often times.
B:	But.
A:	So. Yeah.
B:	Well, we have to keep talking, I guess
A:	Well, no,
A:	I guess we can end.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's just whenever we're, um.
B:	Oh, is it really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you always gone until the recording?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I don't, I don't, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess we're not supposed to
B:	I don't know,
B:	we're I guess we're supposed to wait
B:	or I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I,
B:	you know, like one, uh, well,
B:	was it last week, we were supposed to talk about gardening
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and it was really funny,
B:	I, I, I mixed it, made the call,
B:	and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it was really.
B:	We were laughing,
B:	I mean. But, you know, we don't really do any gardening,
B:	so like, that took like a minute
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then we just talked about, you know, whatever, I mean.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Interesting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I mean, some topics,
B:	really now, you know, now, this topic, this is, I mean,
B:	there really isn't much to say after you know, you, uh, you know, you, you tell the person what, uh, news there, uh, you know, where their, where they find their sources of information from
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then, you know, if it's, uh, if they're satisfied,
B:	and that's about it, really.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's hard to talk for five minutes on this
A:	Yeah
B:	So, um.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I guess I can just say I, it bothers me that I hear a lot about, um, you know, on the news that,
A:	well, it seems like, I don't know, some things are sensationalized or some things are, um,
A:	you know, you'll hear one report
A:	and then you'll hear that it, you know, they didn't, um.
A:	Okay.
B:	So, what are your favorite shows?
A:	Um, I like watching COLOMBO and, um, MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP,
B:	Oh, really?
A:	yeah.
B:	QUANTUM LEAP?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did you see it the other night?
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	That was, that was pretty good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that one was.
A:	What about,
B:	What do you,
B:	with the psychic and everything?
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like, uh, I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT.
A:	Oh, I, well I haven't seen either of those
B:	You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Oh, it's a great show.
A:	Um, I also like to watch STAR TREK,
A:	but it's on so late here, that I don't always get to see it
B:	Really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we like it, too.
B:	Have you seen the movie?
A:	Uh, I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely, just like in the last year or so got interested in it,
A:	and they're, you know, already out with number six by now,
A:	but. So I haven't seen any of the movies, yet,
A:	but I.
B:	Oh, you haven't seen any of them.
A:	No.
B:	Oh, well, they're good,
B:	they're real good.
B:	They're, uh, they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies, though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which ones are you watching, the new ones?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen quite a few of the older ones.
A:	I haven't seen really the new generation that much.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the the newer one?
B:	Well, they're, they're a lot different.
B:	But, I like, I like the older ones because at that time, you know, they were really futuristic, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And the newer ones are, I guess the newer ones are real futuristic, too,
B:	but I like, I like both of them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do too.
A:	I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot,
A:	I mean, he almost hates the new ones
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something,
A:	but, I don't
B:	No.
B:	Not really.
B:	It's not really like   a soap  opera,
A:	Oh, I think,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, but it's,
B:	but that's true,
B:	I mean, you, you learn more about the characters and stuff,
B:	but that's the way all shows are now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	sure.
A:	Well, let's see.
A:	Um, I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's sort of how Matlock is,
A:	but COLOMBO is way tricky
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them.
B:	Well, it seems like they always  show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college,
A:	Well, did you see the one.
A:	Um.
B:	or is this, is there a series on.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	there's like one on,
A:	well we see it Thursdays at seven,
A:	and  it was,
B:	Okay.
A:	this last time it was about this, um, movie director,
A:	did you
B:	Yeah,
B:	I saw that one.
A:	did you see that?
B:	See, that was a rerun.
A:	Really?
A:	Oh, I guess I
B:	Yeah,
B:	I wondered if that's
A:	Huh.
B:	see I don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what,
B:	but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,
B:	and then, then they keep showing them over and over.
A:	Oh, I guess I've, I haven't seen it before.
B:	He was a movie director,
B:	and he had that gal killed.
A:	Yeah
B:	Okay.
A:	yeah,
A:	on the set or something.
B:	That was pretty good though
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was.
A:	But, yeah,
A:	I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, there's no, never anything good on Saturdays, though
B:	No kidding.
A:	I don't think so.
A:	Well, STAR TREK'S on at five,
A:	but I'm never home
A:	so,
B:	What is it that,
B:	there's something I watch, something I watch on Saturdays,
B:	and I can't remember what it is.
B:	Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS.
A:	Oh.
B:	You never saw that?
A:	I've heard of it a lot,
A:	I've heard of,
A:	a lot of people somehow or something
A:	They'll say, so and so from TWIN PEAKS, or something, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	that was a different soap opera.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, it was, it was a different type of show.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I didn't like the way it ended, though.
A:	Oh, did they end the whole series?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they didn't, they only did it for, I think, two years.
A:	Oh.
B:	But it's all over now.
A:	Oh, another show I like to watch is MASH.
A:	So. How's your products been?
B:	Um, I really haven't had, uh, too many problems.
B:	Uh, seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out.
A:	I hear that one.
A:	Have you had any lately go out?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,
B:	and they,
B:	unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,
B:	and, uh, I really don't have any recourse,
B:	so I had to call and have them all repaired and that.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was a hassle.
A:	So you didn't get anything,
A:	even, all the, all the warranties were out?
B:	Yeah,
B:	the warranty on the refrigerator, uh,
B:	the
B:	the refrigerator warranty's still good,
B:	but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,
B:	and it was three years and two months.
A:	You're kidding.
B:	No.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we just moved into a new house, too,
A:	so we had to buy all those, too.
B:	Uh, watch out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the only thing I've had problems with is, um,
A:	I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,
A:	and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings.
A:	So.
B:	Um.
A:	I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,
A:	I just ended up using it.
A:	But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong.
A:	But.
B:	I usually have pretty good luck with appliances,
B:	but I just, uh,
B:	it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,
B:	and the the ice maker was, uh, had to have a new pump,
A:	That's incredible.
B:	and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,
B:	and they, uh,
B:	the dryer had to have a new heating element,
B:	so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them.
A:	And they all went out at the same time?
B:	Uh, within two days of each other.
A:	Or two days.
A:	Wow.
B:	I was,
B:	it wasn't a good week.
B:	I was pretty mad.
B:	And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business,
B:	so even if I, I think even if I had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,
B:	but still they were through that retailer,
B:	so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not.
A:	Wow,
A:	it's frustrating.
B:	But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.
B:	So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I,
B:	the only other things that I've ever had trouble with, uh,
B:	I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	they go out a lot?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had two or three of those go out.
B:	One was under warranty,
B:	and the other two weren't,
B:	but, I just,
B:	other than that, you know, T V and things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with.
B:	I don't think products are getting much better though.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See I'm in the manufacturing
A:	home from work
A:	and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's interesting.
A:	At Morton International,
A:	and, I
A:	well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment.
A:	We test everything after each assembly process,
A:	and so our testing is pretty thorough,
A:	but.
B:	Do you, do you test each individual one
A:	Um.
B:	or do you just test,
B:	like if you've got ten, you test one,
B:	and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?
A:	Um, the tests that,
A:	well, we test every one electrically.
A:	We don't,
A:	I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,
A:	so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,
A:	and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,
A:	so.
B:	Well, that's something I've never had to use,
B:	it's never, I've never been involved in an automobile accident,
B:	so, luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I think it's a great idea.
B:	I'm, I'm,
B:	seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
B:	but that.
A:	Well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,
A:	it's incredible how much testing they have to do.
B:	Oh, I'm sure they want to be thorough before they.
B:	But, uh, even,
B:	you know, I don't mind spending the extra money on the car if, you know, even if they pass the savings, the cost onto the consumer, because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm not a real big seat belt,
B:	my, uh,
A:	Well Jackie, uh, on taxes, I, I guess I would have to say, that I, that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes.
A:	Uh, what's your feeling about that?
B:	I agree.
B:	I think taxes are high.
A:	Right,
A:	uh, where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, uh-huh.
A:	In New Hampshire we have, uh, uh, no, no, what we call broad base taxes.
A:	No income tax and no sales tax.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, we tax business, uh, eight percent,
A:	businesses are taxed eight percent
A:	and we have what we call the five B s. Uh, for our taxes. Booze, uh, butts, cigarettes, beds, uh, hotel room tax bellies, a meal tax and bets, gambling.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, we do have a very low tax rate,
A:	but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes
A:	and .
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree
B:	and I, think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting,
B:	well if you do get money back from like jobs,
B:	I'm still a student so, uh, I only work part time,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	so I, I get a check back
B:	so
A:	Well that's nice.
B:	from, from taxes
B:	but,
A:	Nice, nice to get a refund.
B:	Yeah
B:	It is,
B:	but it's not much.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you think that, uh, for whatever taxes we do pay that, uh, we are getting value for it?
B:	No.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state
A:	and they say they are going to send some back,
A:	it's like giving yourself a it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know what I mean?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, it, it really, uh,
A:	I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because,  Right because, uh, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect
B:	Yeah.
B:	There you go
A:	and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
A:	and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, uh, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I,
B:	don't seem like they are doing much with it,
B:	I mean there's plans there
B:	and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into drug and that stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They have nice plans
B:	and, uh, but, they don't always work
B:	and then you know they try to raise taxes more
B:	and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work,
B:	you know, but taxes get raise
B:	so. I don't know.
B:	I'm not really into politics, uh
A:	That it,
B:	I don't really understand it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's just you know
A:	Well, it does it, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.
A:	Uh, it's almost like they will spend as much as the, they're allowed to collect. You know.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.
A:	There would be no figuring.
A:	I mean you would take your income tax,
A:	you would have a certain amount,
A:	I mean you would take you total salary
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,
A:	and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have,
A:	and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who's in your family.
B:	Right.
B:	Huh.
A:	And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S
A:	and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The could be nice
A:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	I, I'd like to see something like that.
A:	I think it would be fairer
A:	and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business
A:	and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,
A:	but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.
B:	Right,
B:	huh.
A:	It doesn't seem fair to me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it isn't,
B:	there is not much out there that is fair,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Right.
B:	Huh.
B:	I will agree to that.
A:	I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. I, I, if I am not mistaken, aren't they? I mean for your state.
B:	Uh,
A:	What is, do you know what your state income tax rate is?
B:	Um, no
A:	Twenty percent?
B:	I, I have no idea,
B:	I just.
B:	My dad does it all for me
A:	Just, you just pay it, huh
B:	I use,
A:	You're like, you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts
A:	and, uh, she works as a waitress
A:	and she is attending college full time also
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she sends her taxes to me
A:	and I figure them up.
A:	She really has no idea.
A:	She gets a refund check
A:	and,
A:	Okay.
A:	How do you keep up with current events?
B:	Um, well actually, usually, uh, in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work, uh,
B:	usually catch the news in the morning.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what what channel do you watch or what station?
B:	Uh, N B C.
A:	That's the one I watch.
A:	I usually keep up with T V.
A:	I don't,
A:	I am a student
A:	so I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great sometimes
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I usually tend to just, you know, rely on, you know, T V, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are
B:	and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I'm interested in any particular one.
A:	Yeah.
A:	The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.
A:	The stations I listen to are just mainly music.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you think that T V is, uh, pretty accurate.
A:	I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
A:	or,
B:	Well, what I really don't like about T V, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed
B:	and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack, on the way to school, you know?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's
A:	they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Also, also I have the observation of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press, you know, which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's something wrong.
A:	Going,
A:	they're, looks like they're going more for ratings than for you know actual news.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think, you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they typically have a better.
A:	I am from a small town too here in Texas and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	the farm report.
A:	Yeah,
A:	farm report and oil reports.
A:	That's pretty pretty sad
A:	or who killed who.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television .
B:	Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down
B:	and,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, in, uh, in Dallas, I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's
A:	and the story was, uh,
B:	Was that like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something?
A:	Yeah.
A:	And the news covered it right, you know, hours after it happened
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they were taping people who were crying who had everything
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then like three days later this, uh, local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just thought that was really that's kind of cold,
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	I have seen that happen lots of times.
B:	You know, uh, Channel X gives you the best coverage
B:	you know we were on the scene with our team players
B:	and,
A:	Yeah
A:	and it was just,
A:	they were showing like these dead people
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and they were showing people crying
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I mean just taking advantage of you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	They are trying to get the, you know, most emotional response for,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,
A:	but just the play on people's emotions
A:	It's just gotten so,
A:	I mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know
B:	Yeah
A:	and everything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You know, I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down,
A:	Yeah.
B:	very,
A:	What did you think of the coverage of the war?
B:	Uh, I I found it very one sided.
A:	Did you?
B:	Uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, you know, not saying that we that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,
B:	but it just seemed like, you know.
A:	They kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing
A:	and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they kind of you know,
A:	if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states, you know that the the military basically sets the press,
A:	Think about, uh, taxes.
B:	Well, I think they're a necessary evil.
B:	Uh, I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, uh, businesses operate on
B:	and that is, uh you, you don't spend more than you, than you bring in.
A:	You spend what you have
A:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that, the general idea is to you know, spend, uh, during a time of recession that, you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy,
A:	but they're running under the
A:	you know, the way they're running it now, they're you know, running it under a deficit spending, you know, while we're not under a recession,
A:	so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running,
A:	so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, keep spending, keep going into debt,
A:	you're not going to payoff what you owe,
A:	but, so, I guess the, the question was more like, uh, do you get what you pay you know, get what you pay for.
B:	Well, I,
B:	it just depends.
B:	Uh, uh, roads are very expensive, uh, commodity and so is, uh, utilities they supply and police and fire department, uh,
B:	you know, they need to make a living.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There's,
B:	So I think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I agree with that.
B:	But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
A:	I guess,
A:	I'm, I'm a student right now
A:	and I don't make a whole lot of money
A:	and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored.
A:	I go to a state sponsored school
A:	and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff,
A:	so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.
A:	My parents, I guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything,
A:	but, uh, I usually end up getting money back.
A:	I will this year anyway from a,
B:	Uh, you're very fortunate.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I am
A:	I need it, too,
A:	otherwise,
B:	We just try not to pay any more in than we have to,
B:	uh, we pay in a substantial amount. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We don't regret paying taxes.
B:	We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And progressive tax, I think, uh, does not give people incentive to make more money,
B:	and what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay.
A:	More taxes you pay.
B:	It should be, I think, a flat percentage
B:	and, uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Isn't,
B:	Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I totaled them all up
B:	and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
A:	Wow.
B:	Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well isn't,
B:	But, you know, there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh,
B:	like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.
B:	You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your tank.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The taxes that people don't think about that,
A:	yeah,
A:	the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.
B:	But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	There was that,
A:	which
A:	was it Jerry Brown,
A:	one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a I think a flat percentage, something like that.
B:	Yeah
B:	if you implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money
B:	and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
A:	Right.
A:	Exactly.
A:	That's, because until, like eight,
B:	And so,
B:	Based on that, who do you think you're talking to,
B:	you're talking to an employer.
A:	Up until, like, eighty-five or something was the,
A:	Well, actually, uh,
A:	I, I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in Texas
A:	I don't think I agree with,
B:	Oh really.
A:	No.
B:	You don't believe in it?
A:	Uh, I wouldn't say that.
A:	I think I would have said that a few years ago.
A:	When I was younger I thought it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment
A:	but, um, uh, maybe slowly changing my opinion.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not thoroughly opposed to it.
A:	I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment
A:	but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought
B:	You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She has very, very black and white opinions, you know.
B:	There's no gray in her opinions, you know.
B:	She, she probably would agree more with you
B:	but, but I don't know.
B:	I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again.
B:	I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to, to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we see that more and more.
B:	Like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, that's fourteen years old.
B:	What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I certainly don't, uh, advocate turning people like that loose.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not sure executing them, uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail,
A:	but, uh,
B:	No
B:	it doesn't
B:	but, it costs less.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That, that's a factor.
B:	And, yeah,
B:	to me it is.
B:	I mean, I work and I pay my taxes
B:	and I lived out in Texas for a little while
B:	and they're
B:	and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia
B:	I mean you guys are, are a lot more, uh, for to each his own even than we are in Georgia.
A:	Right.
B:	But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.
B:	If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I,
A:	the cost is something
A:	but it's, but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of, dealing with crime
A:	and I guess I would like,
A:	I don't know,
A:	the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment
A:	and they  they don't have a crime problem either.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	No,
A:	you can't,
A:	they don't execute anybody in Britain or France
A:	and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either
A:	and they don't have the crime problems we do.
A:	I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, uh, when I see people enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing
A:	and the, that, that bothers me.
B:	You might be right.
A:	But it,
A:	but, uh,
B:	I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, you know,
B:	I would never in a million years want that job
A:	Huh.
B:	but I do believe it's necessary
B:	and I,
A:	Yeah.
B:	On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
A:	Huh.
B:	and I couldn't pull the switch
B:	but, uh,
A:	Well actually I,
A:	the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, uh, I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.
A:	I think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians
A:	so
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed, uh, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that.
A:	I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and  nor the other way around.
B:	What  what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing
A:	Uh, I guess I'm, I'm,
A:	my view of uh,
A:	my,
A:	I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, uh, uh, than anything else
A:	and, uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two friends whose wives were murdered
A:	and, uh  I can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.
B:	Oh, gosh
B:	Oh yes,
B:	if it ever touched my
B:	I don't know what you drive now.
B:	I mean, what do you drive now?
A:	Uh, I have a Ford pickup
A:	and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan. And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	so, uh
B:	Throw them in the back.
A:	they sort of fit our requirement.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have a, one of those, uh, pickups with the, uh, seat  with a seat in the back.
B:	Cab.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	And so they just fit in there.
A:	When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.
B:	Yeah
A:	Right now, I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room
A:	and, uh and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back
B:	There you go.
A:	and I kind of like having a pickup truck.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Actually, I think of it as a as a car that'll last
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	I know.
A:	I like the way trucks are built
A:	and I don't care about comfort.
A:	So, I'm pretty happy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you're looking at,
B:	I got a Toyota Four Runner.
B:	I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too,
B:	so I got a Four Runner.
A:	So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one.
A:	I, I never buy new
A:	so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.
B:	You're just like me.
B:	I've never bought a new vehicle in my life.
A:	And, uh, yeah,
A:	I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz.
A:	I'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine
B:	No.
A:	and I'll pay for the rest of it.
B:	Let somebody else break it in,
B:	right
A:	Right.
A:	And, uh, the van we're
A:	we might go again on a, on a van.
A:	We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.
A:	I'm not sure.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years
A:	but, uh,  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon
B:	Right.
A:	and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, it certainly had that.
A:	We didn't do much to it at all.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my, my,
B:	pretty much the same.
B:	I, I got a, like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to.
B:	I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds
B:	so I can tow everything
B:	and it,
B:	I can throw,
B:	I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it's real reliable,
B:	I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now
B:	and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything wrong with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided,
B:	I don't know,
B:	it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world,
B:	but it blew a head gasket.
A:	Uh-oh.
B:	Didn't do any damage to it.
B:	Uh, I caught  it real early.
A:	How,
A:	at how  at how many miles?
B:	Uh, oh ninety-seven thousand.
A:	Huh.
B:	So it's not real early
A:	You didn't overheat it?
B:	No.
B:	Never overheated it.
B:	I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the coolant
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Went out and looked.
B:	Saw it was, saw where it was coming from.
B:	Drove it right to the shop and left it off.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well that was, ,
B:	And that was it
B:	because I, I have that
B:	and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle.
B:	It, it's a
B:	I don't know,
B:	people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
A:	I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining
A:	and, uh, uh, he's a,
A:	it's,
A:	he's pretty conservative guy.
A:	I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess, uh,
B:	I know
B:	but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.
A:	I'm sure he does,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know,
B:	when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving?
B:	Yeah.
A:	No
B:	And I go out twice a week on the bike, so. At least. Just for  the enjoyment.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh .
A:	Yeah
B:	But, yeah,
B:	I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,
B:	uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, just an open bed to throw stuff in.
A:	Right.
B:	I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very,
B:	I mean you got one.
B:	It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
B:	and,
A:	If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.
B:	Right.
A:	I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.
B:	To have it out of the way.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, they're solid.
A:	Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,
B:	I think they last a lot longer than anything else.
A:	They're the only things Americans still know how to build
A:	and, uh
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	the trucks do.
B:	Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too.
B:	But so are the,
B:	though I think the Chevies,
B:	I don't think the
B:	I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.  At least until recently
A:	Right.
A:	I  I kind of like mine,
A:	yeah,
A:	so, mine's a Ford
B:	A friend of mine just bought , bought like a year ago. It, it's a really nice truck.
B:	I mean, I don't like Dodges at all
B:	but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.
A:	Oh, I heard about that,
A:	yes.
B:	Oh, it's beautiful.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That thing, that thing will last forever I mean ,
A:	That, that's a serious truck.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that thing's, uh,
B:	it's got a boat engine in it
A:	Right,
A:	this, uh,
A:	I, I know a contractor who just got one of those.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's pleased with it.
A:	Well I haven't had an awful lot of, uh, incidents regarding child care.
A:	When my two year old was in New Orleans, she got bit on the cheek
A:	and, uh, but, uh, that's about the, the, uh, the extent of it.
A:	But, but, but when,
A:	I really am, am concerned about is that, uh, so many of these child care places are, are coming under, uh, uh, you know, investigation for, for, uh, you know, child molestation.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, and I, and I'm saying to myself, well, you know, you dump your, your, your little turnip off to, uh, you know, this child care place
A:	and they don't pay very much
A:	and why, why would they be interested in, in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, that's a terrible kind of thing
A:	and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that
A:	but my wife didn't work
A:	and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well I am a working mother
B:	I have three children
B:	and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young,
B:	I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements
B:	and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it.
B:	I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home
B:	and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children.
B:	My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.
A:	Huh.
B:	So I, I, I,
B:	you know, it is a problem.
B:	And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities
B:	and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford.
B:	When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.
A:	Huh.
B:	And then as they got older, they went to, uh, I preferred to call them schools
B:	and they were really all day preschools
B:	and they were wonderful.
B:	And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things.
A:	Oh, well that's interesting.
B:	But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune.
B:	I mean we were paying at one point, well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children.
A:	Oh, my God.
B:	So.
A:	Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
B:	Well, I
B:	I'm a physician. Uh  and, as is my husband.
A:	Oh, well, yeah
B:	And, and I felt, uh, very good about working.
B:	I'm a pediatrician actually.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
B:	but, and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think,
A:	Well, not, not all of us.
A:	You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for.
A:	I'm an engineer.
B:	Oh. Well
A:	And,
B:	I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in.
B:	And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh,
B:	I'm with the university actually
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three
B:	and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work.
B:	And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing.
B:	And they had wonderful,
B:	they had things like gardens and lots of pets
B:	and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So that, that sort of an,
B:	most of the teachers had degrees. Uh,
A:	Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's incredible.
B:	It was incredible actually
A:	Oh, oh.
B:	But it was good.
B:	I mean it was, it,
B:	at that time there were two children
B:	and they were in special programs
B:	and each one was a little over two hundred a week
B:	and then, in addition, I paid a little bit extra.
B:	But the kids were,
A:	Well.
B:	I mean they really had some great opportunities.
B:	But,
B:	what you were alluding to earlier is, you know, women who work for minimal wage  and, and really have feel they have to put their children,
A:	Yeah.
B:	sometimes they do put them in, uh, fairly low  paying situations.
A:	You know,
A:	they could,
A:	somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare
A:	and you know, that's a good starting wage
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No,
B:	even that, that really, I think, I don't,
B:	it's been awhile since I've looked at,
B:	my youngest child is eight.
B:	So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers.
B:	But they are
A:	Huh.
B:	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .
A:	I mean we used to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit.
A:	But mine are twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven
A:	so you know, that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
B:	Something like that.
A:	Oh my.
B:	Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children.
B:	I mean it has been a real, uh,
B:	there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences.
B:	And I think, I think they have captured a certain market.
B:	Again the,
B:	but then there are baby-sitting groups.
B:	As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Hi, Cynthia.
A:	What did you wear to work today?
B:	Um, let's see.
B:	What did I wear to work today?
B:	Um, actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse, um, and flat shoes.
A:	So, can you dress pretty casually?
B:	Um, on occasion. On occasion.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I do vary.
B:	Um, you know, I wear suits,
B:	I wear skirts and sweaters.
B:	On occasion I can wear jeans.
B:	Um, how about you?
A:	Well, I, um, run a business out of my home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I tend to get up in the morning, put on, sweats, um, do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting with a client, I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.
B:	Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.
B:	I, um, don't like to wear heels, that really tires me out.
B:	I work in a big building.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.
B:	Um, you know, in the winter I wear sweaters,
B:	in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.
A:	I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits together that I can interchange, the, jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	That's helped me a lot with having,
A:	I can only have a, a limited wardrobe, since I'm only, working part-time right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but still, it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	accessories,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	What about your casual wear?
A:	Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?
B:	Um, yeah
B:	mostly.
B:	I mean, at home I predominantly wear laughs while saying remainder of sweatpants and things like that, also.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so hot.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, they're, um, you know, they're like
A:	Dress shorts.
B:	yeah,
B:	they're like black corduroy Bermuda shorts.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And sometimes I wear a blazer with them,
B:	and I get really a lot of compliments on them.
B:	Um, where I work is predominantly male.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know, they,
B:	their attire is always the same, you know. Suits or slacks, you know, jeans, whatever.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but ,
B:	And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,
B:	but seems to work for me
A:	Yeah,
A:	but .
B:	In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,
B:	it's one of those skorts,
B:	you know,
B:	it's shorts but it looks like a skirt.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I think that'll be good for work, too.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It'll be comfortable.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	I guess down here, uh,
A:	we just recently moved to Texas,
A:	so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, we moved from Colorado where,
A:	and I have a closet full of sweaters.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That,
B:	Well, see, I live in Virginia.
A:	You live in Virginia, now?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, I'm,
B:	you know, like right now, today was in about, you know, the fifties.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'd like to be able to wear those here.
A:	Today it's eighty-eight degrees.
B:	Oh, my
A:	So
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes here.
A:	This is pretty unseasonal,
A:	but, uh, at least, we,
A:	you know, it, it, it feels good,
A:	it gets, uh,
A:	everybody doesn't have cabin fever today.
A:	It's nice to get, out and about.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing
A:	Okay.
A:	Sounds good.
B:	Okay?
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	Okay,
B:	it was nice talking to you, also.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Hi.
B:	Hi,
B:	um, okay
B:	what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of music do you like?
A:	Well, I mostly listen to popular music.
A:	I, uh, listen to it all the time in, in my car,
A:	so, I, I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials.
A:	But, uh, I find myself listening to popular music,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, quite honestly, I, I have some little children
A:	and I, unfortunately, found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately,
A:	but that's not by my choice.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	I just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it.
A:	Oh, with the Santa Claus on the cover.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	I've already ordered from that one,
A:	but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, do you live, where do you,
B:	what state are you in?
A:	Texas.
B:	Oh, you're in Texas.
A:	Yes,
A:	I'm in the Dallas area. In Plano.
B:	So am I.
B:	I'm in Garland.
A:	Uh so that's not too far.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so I guess they get people from all over.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	driving for Thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for,
A:	Well it was when we left last year.
A:	We left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit Colorado
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we pulled in just as it hit.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, how do you go?
A:	Do you go up through the Raton Pass, when you go up there?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	oh,
B:	well, wait a minute,
B:	yeah,
B:	we do,
B:	we do.
A:	That's on like Route two eighty-seven or something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I Twenty-five from there.
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	we, uh, went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U Haul trailer,
A:	because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage.
A:	So, we went all interstate.
A:	We went up, um, through Oklahoma City and then up through, uh, Kansas, and then turned left and went in on I Seventy
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour.
A:	It was a little more mile wise
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the,
B:	All set.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Actually I'm in Plano, too
A:	That's okay.
B:	I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere.
A:	That's okay,
A:	it's more, uh, concentrated, so they know where you are.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, anyway, I know here in, here in Plano some of the things that we do are, um, Kroger
A:	and some of the other stores, too, have said, If you bring your bags back to, to the store to recycle, then they'll pay you a certain amount of money,
A:	and that's one thing that started in the community.
B:	They actually pay you money for that?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, um, Brookshires up in uh, Allen, uh, you bring your bags back, you know, they, uh, the plastic bags back or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there,
B:	but I didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that. Um.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know Kroger will do it,
A:	and I think Albertson's does it sometimes,
A:	I'm not sure.
A:	Um, and, and yet, I know that, uh, some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay the, the, uh, community, like through the schools or things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Interesting.
A:	So, um, that's always helpful,
A:	and I know that we we have the, the can, the can, different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, one of the ways,
A:	I don't know, uh, if this would be helpful.
A:	It said on the, the computer, what do I think would be helpful.
A:	And I don't know if it would be helpful or not,
A:	but I know on Monday, the, the garbage men pick up like just, um, any limbs or any extra trash that you might have,
B:	Right.
A:	And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a, a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put, like either glass or newspapers or whatever.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think they already do that out East.
B:	Um, they have to, it's a little bit more difficult, because people have to remember, Okay, today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic, and all that
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I think that's the way we need to go.
B:	It's, uh, it's pretty bad.
B:	All these years we've
B:	been, especially in this country, all the, uh, the plastic and the paper and everything, we just used to throw out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, I know getting a newspaper everyday, I know I could just, you know, do that because I have to pick it up,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it just goes out with our trash,
A:	and I guess I'm not as, um, recycling minded as I should be
A:	but that goes out with the trash,
A:	and it really could be recycled.
B:	Yeah,
B:	about six months ago I started
A:	Did you?
B:	yeah,
B:	and, uh so what I do is, uh,
A:	Tell me.
B:	it's not bad,
B:	you just have to have a place to keep everything,
B:	but, uh, it, you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it.
B:	Just put your paper in the same place every day,
B:	and it'll start stacking up.
B:	Take your glass, um, you know, pickle jars, or, or whatever, uh, liquid jars, you know,
B:	just rinse them out a little bit
B:	and put them all in a place,
B:	and, uh plastics,
A:	Don't you have to take like labels off of those jars?
B:	No,
B:	from what I understand, uh, you can leave the labels on, um, although I rip, rip them off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't, I don't scrub them or anything,
B:	I just tear them off
A:	Take them off,
A:	yeah.
B:	throw the lids and everything out,
B:	but, uh, put all the glass in one place, and plastics, like milk jugs, uh, orange juice jugs, things like that.
A:	Soda,
A:	both liter sodas
B:	Yes
A:	can you do that.
B:	those also.
A:	Okay.
B:	Um, and then, of course, uh, cans, coke cans, whatever.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	But, uh, I haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take, and all that,
B:	I've just read a lot about it,
B:	and I'm keeping these big piles of it right now
B:	I going to try to dump it out this weekend in fact.
B:	But, uh, you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up.
B:	There's a lot that we throw out.
A:	I, I know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just, um, get it into different categories like that,
A:	and I, I don't know what it would take to, to get my children to start working on it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have two older ones that probably would go along with the, if I had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project, you know.
B:	It's, yeah, it's not a big deal.
B:	You get used to it.
B:	One,
B:	let me tell you one interesting thing
A:	Okay,
B:	when I went back to the store, and I said, Hey, um, I understand you all are taking these bags back, uh, you know, what do you do with them.
B:	And they told me, they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then, you know, go and recycle the rest.
B:	And I said, What do you mean the ones that don't belong there?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they said, Well, people come in and put anything in the receptacles.
B:	And what I found out is, if you look at the bottom of those bags, Kroger or whatever the plastic ones, they've got numbers on them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and if it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number, like bags from Drug Emporium have a ...
A:	Hello.
B:	Hello.
A:	Hello,
B:	Hello,
A:	Hi.
A:	Boy
A:	it took forever to find somebody.
B:	Oh, well I'm glad you found me.
A:	Good,
A:	well I'm, my name's Gail,
A:	and I guess we have to, talk about credit cards.
B:	Yes.
B:	My name is Carolyn.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, if you're ready, then uh,
B:	Okay.
B:	I'll just let you start,
A:	Okay,
A:	I'll press one
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I'm not,
A:	this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me, because credit cards are my downfall.
A:	I just find it so easy to, to charge something when I don't have the money to pay for it,
A:	and I'm really trying to get out of that habit.
A:	So. I think they're kind of dangerous.
B:	I think they are, too.
B:	And, unfortunately, um, we use ours in, we don't use them all the time,
B:	but we use them like at Christmas time,
B:	and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me too.
B:	I think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them, um, that's what gets to be the really scary part, you know, if you think, when it comes around to income tax time, and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year,
B:	you could really get a lot more stuff if you were just able to pay outright for it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true,
A:	that's true.
A:	Seems just like our society is so, um, pushes so hard for, you can have it, you know, and then no interest, no payments for a year, and stuff like this,
A:	they're really trying to get you into that situation, because they know they've really got you then,
A:	so.
B:	all I know is some of my credit cards,
B:	like, um, we have a Sears one,
B:	and we always get a maintenance agreement every year
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's just easier to say, you know, just put that on my credit card.
B:	Well that's probably four or five hundred dollars, you know, that goes on at that point
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then it seems like takes forever to pay that off.
A:	It's funny, that we've got a Sears card, and we bought a washer and dryer on it, four years ago, and we still owe.
A:	I mean, I, I think like half the amount that they cost in the first place.
B:	Wow.
A:	It's just, uh, you know, you never, never get it out,
A:	and now that's real irritating.
B:	It sure is.
B:	We eventually did,
B:	one time we just borrowed, took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards,
B:	and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was, you know, to just have that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We haven't done it lately.
B:	We probably need to do it again.
A:	Well, we did, you know,
A:	one time, we wanted to buy a truck, a used truck,
A:	and so we went down to the bank,
A:	and they said, Sure we'll give you a personal loan.
A:	It was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they said, sure that's no problem, but, you know, why don't we consolidate your bills,
A:	and at the time we thought, Oh, that would be great, you know, we could,
A:	and it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them,
A:	you only have to write one check a month, not all those.
A:	You never miss one or whatever
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we did that,
A:	but we didn't realize at the time, until several months later, that we, we were real,
A:	I mean this was four three years ago,
A:	we were pretty young
A:	and we were just kind of like,
A:	well, I guess that means these credit cards are closed,
A:	and we didn't, you know,
A:	about six months later we realized we could use them,
A:	and so we charged them all up again.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before, but also adding the lower payment for all of them,
A:	So we were paying like twice.
A:	Um, so we didn't ever make that mistake again, luckily
A:	But, uh, we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing.
A:	We just,
A:	as a matter of fact, this, it's real interesting the subjects I get.
A:	They always seem to be so pertinent.
A:	But we just discussed this last night at church, talking about debt and things like that.
A:	It's so, so alluring, and uh, so easy to get,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, sometimes,
B:	I know,
B:	they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	And, uh, if you could stick to that, you know, we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
A:	Oh, I just picked up my daughter
A:	and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over.
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What a mess you are.
A:	Oh, so I don't know, if I, if I, I just feel kind of.
A:	My big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card,
A:	and I just thought, you know, if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something, you know and we had to, had to buy one, then we would really need that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so he said, Okay we'll keep it,
A:	and then we weren't smart enough to not use it,
A:	so.
B:	You know, one thing you might do with, in a situation like that, though, it's just like keep,
A:	Okay,
A:	so you're into microwave cooking.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's just, it's so easy nowadays, you know,
B:	and it's, uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
B:	and it be ready in just a few minutes
A:	, yes,
A:	and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it,
A:	something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week.
B:	All week.
B:	Well, we've done that, too.
B:	There's just my husband and I,
B:	and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot uh, pot of spaghetti
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half,
B:	and I kind of get sick of it after he
A:	I know.
A:	I try not to make too much.
A:	It's just my husband and I, too
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week
B:	Yeah
A:	but, uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, you know, something like that or sometimes a roast,
B:	Right.
A:	but,
B:	Right.
A:	What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?
B:	Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas
A:	Oh, oh.
B:	it's, it's really good,
B:	I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it.
A:	Ooh,
A:	that sounds delicious.
B:	So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about you?
A:	I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it
A:	you have to cook very little to go with it, just some rice and some salad
A:	and that's about it, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, what do you put in it?
A:	Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts
A:	and then you take and make a, a dressing out of, uh, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ooh,
B:	that sounds good.
A:	and you mix it up,
A:	and you just put it on the top of the chicken,
A:	and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's delicious
B:	Ooh,
B:	that sounds good.
A:	and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in the door, you know, and then, uh, go about my business,
A:	and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's chicken's done.
B:	Is done,
B:	right.
A:	So that's a real easy thing for me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that sounds good, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've got a, um, a great recipe for cheese cake.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,
B:	but
A:	No,
A:	I don't,
A:	my mom gets that,
A:	but,
B:	they have one,
B:	if you like to cook, they have,
B:	every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one
A:	Really.
B:	and, um, you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes,
B:	but, I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake,
B:	and it's just a regular cheese cake,
B:	and then you can put raspberry, uh, topping on it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but inside the cheese cake, uh, recipe you put, um, lemon peel and orange peel
A:	Um.
B:	and it's just enough to taste it, you know, when, when, when you're eating the cheese cake,
B:	and it is wonderful,
B:	but it takes a long time, because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty-five minutes and then you're supposed to, um, I think, chill it to room temperature
A:	Um.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day,
B:	but it's, it's very good.
A:	Well, I love cheese cake.
A:	I have never been, I don't know, the ones
A:	I have made I have not done that well with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like a baked cheese cake, you know,
A:	I don't,
A:	I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, you know
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but that's not the same as a, a New York style cheese cake.
B:	No
B:	it's not.
A:	And, uh, the recipes that I've used,
A:	everybody will say, Oh, this is real simple,
A:	and then I make it,
A:	and it's, it's really not very good
B:	Right.
A:	but yours sounds good.
A:	I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness.
B:	It does,
B:	and it, it, it is really good.
A:	Um. Well, that sounds interesting,
A:	so there's your good dessert for your dinner party.
B:	Right
A:	Are you into serving wines with your dinner party?
B:	Oh, sometimes,
B:	but I mean, I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means.
A:	Me, either.
A:	I wish I knew more about it.
B:	I've been to, you know, some wine tastings up in Napa Valley
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, you know, and I learned a little bit about them then,
B:	but you know what would be fun, they have some of those classes you can take
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They would be, if you just had time to do it.
B:	yeah,
B:	and then there's places, um,
B:	do you live in Dallas
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	okay,
B:	there's places here that, um, offer,
B:	I think it's like once a month,
B:	you can go and, to a particular restaurant or whatever,
B:	and you can kind of take a cooking class
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you get to eat everything afterwards,
B:	and then they also go into the wines, you know to serve with, you know, different types of of meals and that kind of thing,
A:	Well, how neat.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it sounds like it's a lot of fun.
B:	We have some friends who've done that,
B:	and they've really enjoyed it.
A:	Um, well, I didn't even know they were offering that.
A:	I guess I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	this place is called like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it sounds like, like it,
A:	Jay, um,
A:	my kids are, are both in college, um,
A:	and I'd, I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.
A:	On the other hand, they really decided themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, what, what kind of experience did you have?
B:	Well, I, uh,
B:	one girl went in, in state and has graduated,
B:	and then, uh, that was, uh, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have, uh, one, out of, two out of state, both in Missouri,
B:	and, um, I teach, uh, in a college,
B:	and so I they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.
B:	Uh, so, that was pretty much, uh.
A:	Um.
A:	I see,
A:	well, I, may, maybe I'm wrong,
A:	but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and, and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.
B:	Oh, oh, if they, if they're content there,
B:	I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, that, uh, it's very little difference is paid to it, where you get that bachelor's.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if they can get, uh, um, two out of,
B:	let's see, my son got a full total scholarships
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so there's, uh, there's plenty of scholarships out there,
B:	and so people should be advised to look for those,
B:	and, um,
A:	Did, did you play a, a strong role in helping them pick schools
A:	or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
B:	Uh.
A:	and,
B:	Well, they, uh,
B:	I went, we went around,
B:	my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,
B:	and so there you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that was limited to five or six different places
B:	and, um, so he's in Saint Louis U,
B:	and I guess I played a role in that.
B:	I, I just sort of, uh, let them, um, you know,
B:	they'd all been, uh pretty efficient as far as studies
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, so I didn't have that much to do,
B:	they just, uh they just knew they wanted to go to college,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I, you know, helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We did do that,
B:	and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's a great idea,
A:	I mean, that,
B:	Some people don't do it,
B:	and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,
B:	so if it's possible.
A:	Right.
A:	It's, it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but, but the compared to the, the total decision it's nothing.
B:	Right.
B:	I think in the short run it is expensive.
B:	In the long run it's very, uh, reasonable if the person,
A:	Yeah.
B:	my daughter has been in, in Missouri for a second year,
B:	now she's coming home at the end of the semester
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, uh, you know, she's already twenty-one.
B:	She started late.
B:	So that's, you know, strictly up to her,
B:	and, uh, she'll finish down here, uh, uh, finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition
A:	Yeah.
B:	but again, that's her decision
A:	Right.
B:	so, uh, but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,
B:	and they're much better students at twenty-five, twenty-six, may, twenty-eight.
B:	So, you know, I don't, I never have pushed them.
B:	I just say that education is important, you should do it, uh,
B:	but, uh, they have to do the work
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, back, back to this visiting thing,
A:	I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and, and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them and to, uh, in reference to what we had seen.
B:	Oh, I think so.
B:	And also I'm opposed to the, to the size.
B:	They've just gotten so huge,
B:	and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,
B:	see that's just too many.
A:	Good grief
B:	Ended up going to where I used to go,
B:	and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there,
B:	it's twenty-one thousand, now
B:	it's too big.
A:	Good grief.
B:	So,
A:	What is twenty-one thousand?
B:	Pardon?
A:	What school is that?
B:	It's Southwest Missouri State University
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago,
B:	and, uh, my son's in a school about seven thousand,
B:	and that's, that's not bad
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I teach in a school about eight thousand,
B:	and that's, that's even a little large
A:	Yes.
B:	but it's much better than twenty-one thousand.
B:	But they do have to visit, and if, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then, oh, those rating, uh,
B:	the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,
B:	I don't think it hurts to look at them
A:	Yes.
B:	I don't put that much stock in them,
B:	but
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	probably fine just to compare.
A:	Helps to at least set up range of things to look at.
B:	Right.
B:	If they, you know, uh, they need to,
A:	Okay,
A:	who do you like?
B:	Okay,
B:	What kind do I like?
B:	I like just about any kind except country and western.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the same with me, same with me.
B:	It's, it's, course country
B:	and western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like Clint Black, he's pretty good,
A:	and who's the other big guy?
B:	Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks
A:	Garth Brooks,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.
A:	Yeah,
A:	in fact I think both of them have performed here.
A:	And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, you know on the verge of country western.
B:	Right.
B:	Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, uh, you know,
B:	his, his home town is about, uh, fifteen minutes away
A:	Oh, wonderful.
B:	so he is, he's a home boy
A:	Well, then, of course you like him.
A:	That's great.
A:	But, well, I have teen age children,
A:	and so, you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's my personal favorite.
B:	My son is, uh, twenty-eight,
B:	so, but he, he's real unusual in that, uh,
B:	he likes a little bit of every kind.
B:	He likes jazz and, uh, blues and, and course the rock
A:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator music at my house.
A:	But I've got teenagers,
A:	so.
B:	Well, my teenagers are all gone.
B:	I can listen to any music I want to
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good,
A:	I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often, but, uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music.
A:	It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, you know, uh, lot of symphonies
A:	and, I just, I love that,
A:	that's probably my all-time favorite.
B:	You know, uh, I, I teach
A:	Um.
B:	and we can have music in the classroom,
B:	but it, you know, it can't be the rock or anything like that
A:	Right.
B:	and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them and yet it's, it's, it stimulates them,
A:	Right.
A:	Relax,
B:	and and, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	What do you teach, what grade?
B:	Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve
A:	Good for you.
B:	and,
A:	A certain subject?
B:	Well, it's, uh, business technology.
A:	Good for you.
B:	But, uh
A:	I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller, uh,
A:	I was reading
A:	my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college
B:	oh, boy,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's pretty good,
A:	it's just a real basic class,
A:	but we're learning a lot,
A:	and we have a home computer,
A:	so it's, it's very interesting.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I'd learn it too.
B:	Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the subject of music
B:	I, uh,
B:	do you play any instruments?
A:	I play, I play piano,
A:	I took lessons for thirteen years,
A:	and right now my nine year old is taking piano,
A:	and I just got a whole mess of music,
A:	I, I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six five hundred kids.
B:	Ooh, you took on a,
B:	good job.
A:	I did it last year,
A:	and, and, um, I, I just sub at the school,
A:	I don't want to work full time,
A:	so I just sub at the school,
A:	and that's kind of my volunteer thing,
A:	so that, it, it's really neat,
A:	and my older daughter plays the saxophone,
A:	my next son plays the drums,
A:	and my third son just started baritone this year,
A:	and my little girl will start French horn next year,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn.
A:	Oh.
B:	So.
A:	French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument.
A:	It's just my favorite.
A:	Of course that's what I played,
A:	and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band once we get the, the French horn
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and I get a little bit more time.
A:	Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.
B:	Yes,
B:	sounds like you've got a houseful.
A:	I do, I do, I love it,
A:	but we have a, a marvelous band instructor,
A:	and, and he's just, he's wonderful.
A:	We have, uh, couple of hundred kids in the band,
A:	our junior high band is just wonderful.
B:	Oh, that's a,
A:	He, lot,
A:	and their concert band,
A:	and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,
A:	and my son will be in next year
A:	that's,
A:	I mean, they play college level music in junior high,
A:	he's that good of an instructor,
A:	and the kids just love him.
B:	Oh, that's wonderful,
A:	So it's really good.
A:	It is wonderful.
B:	I, I have totally, totally a tin ear
A:	Oh do you
B:	and I love music.
B:	I cannot carry a tune in a basket.
B:	I know what I like,
B:	but I
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, and I love to listen to it, love to sing, and I, my kids, when I was little and, they were little
B:	and I was rocking them, singing to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a, am a healthy eater,
B:	Well, I, I try to be as well,
A:	Well, I'm not, uh, I,
A:	there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really,
A:	and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good, uh, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	especially like good prime rib
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,
A:	and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York,
A:	and there are a lot of good restaurants around here.
B:	Oh, you're in New York,
B:	I was going to,
B:	there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it is absolutely wonderful.
A:	Really.
B:	And, uh, we were there a few months ago,
B:	and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey,
B:	well, from New York it probably doesn't matter,
B:	but
A:	Oh, no,
A:	I'm in upstate New York,
A:	and it's actually very inexpensive,
A:	I,
A:	there's a there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh, fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards,
B:	Oh, is it, okay.
B:	Wow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,
B:	and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff,
B:	but it is absolutely wonderful.
A:	Right.
B:	It's the best I have ever had.
A:	Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,
A:	so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas.
B:	Yeah
B:	Well,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure.
B:	so, um, that's,
B:	I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,
A:	but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that they, uh,
A:	I go on,
A:	I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so and, uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	but, I love that,
B:	fresh seafood down there,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great,
A:	you get the crabs
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's like, I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself,
B:	Yeah
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	seafood seems to be a a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food.
A:	That's true.
B:	But it sure is good,
B:	and it's supposed to be good for you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,
B:	Right.
A:	and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
B:	Right.
A:	so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh, but not, uh, not seafood.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you like spicy foods
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili
A:	and around here the big spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and so, uh, it, people, they, you know,
A:	you go out to get the chicken wings
A:	and those are really hot and the hotter the better,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it
A:	Right.
A:	Sure.
B:	and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I like it hot,
B:	but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	My, generally my, my scalp will start,
A:	I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling,
A:	but, uh, I don't know,
A:	but, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine,
A:	I never been really fond of that stuff.
A:	You talk about spicy,
A:	that'll, that'll literally blow your head off,
A:	it's so hot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um,
A:	well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, my tolerances,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too
B:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that's one thing,
B:	and the price.  And the price. Make you want to come back.
A:	What's that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working waitressing jobs or waiter,
B:	Go ahead.
A:	Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.
A:	I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the practice that is they,
A:	I, uh, I don't,
A:	you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards.
A:	Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought.
B:	Do you work for T I?
A:	No, uh,
B:	Oh.
A:	I'm in the Washington area.
A:	I work for N I S T .
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, all right.
B:	Well, see we have the testing already here.
B:	We've had it for, oh, about five years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It used to just be for new employees.
B:	And now  it's for all employees.
A:	And now,
B:	They, uh, randomly select employee numbers
B:	and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested.
A:	Okay,
A:	and how do people feel about it?
B:	So, we're familiar with it.
B:	Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all.
B:	But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things
B:	and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening,
B:	and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.
A:	Well, okay,
A:	that's, that's a very different issue.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too
B:	so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate,
B:	there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts,
B:	and I think some of those require the drug testing,
B:	but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in
B:	and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such.
A:	And,
B:	I haven't personally ever been tested,
B:	but I don't have a problem with it.
A:	Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?
B:	No,
B:	but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.
B:	You know, it happens a lot of times
B:	like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever
B:	and, you know  then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription.
A:	Well ,
B:	Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.
B:	It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name
B:	so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs,
B:	and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for.
A:	So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?
B:	Right.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
B:	When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.
B:	And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs
A:	but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh,
A:	so,
B:	Well, what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.
A:	The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway .
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	I guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff.
B:	They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates amphetamines.
A:	So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.
B:	But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled substance  Well,
A:	Is Contact a,
B:	you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.
A:	Okay.
A:	Is Contact a,  substance?
B:	No.
B:	I'm,  just saying you probably put down on the sheet  anything you have taken.
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.
B:	I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person, but was a contract person,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I
B:	If you are a contract employee here  they test you too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh,
B:	just, he had some kind of flu or something.
B:	He got a real bad migraine
B:	and he took his mother's,
A:	All right.
A:	What is your favorite show?
B:	Well, I was just trying to think.
B:	When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.
B:	Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N
B:	and we took that,
B:	and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,
B:	and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.
B:	The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know,
B:	like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.
A:	Sure.
B:	We have little ones.
B:	Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  how to handle things in situations.
A:	It really is.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you watch?
A:	I watch just about anything,  but not a lot of,  T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I usually watch, you know, the news
A:	and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's the same thing we do.
A:	and I like the NINE ONE ONE,  and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,  the sitcoms.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I haven't gotten,  into many of those.
A:	Now, I do,  like,
A:	my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.
B:	I have heard that's real good.
A:	And I,  uh,
B:	That's,  Burt Reynolds, isn't it?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've heard that.
A:	And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.
B:	Now someone told me that
B:	and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,  because they said that that was really good this season.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, his favorite night is Monday night
A:	so we've got to where we will sit,  and watch it on Monday night,
B:	You've got to yeah,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because that and then that, uh, oh,
A:	I can't even think of the name of it.
A:	Like I say I'm not,
B:	DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,  too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .
B:	Huh, I don't even know.
A:	Sergeant, uh, MAJOR DAD.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Now I,  we've never even seen that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,  and DESIGNING WOMEN.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we always, he watches that
A:	and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,  as I can.
B:	On the others.
B:	Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.
B:	Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the
B:	The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.
A:	Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	That's the thing.
B:	And so,  we,
A:	Except they,   probably are in bed,  by nine.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, they are.
B:	In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,
B:	but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.
A:	Did you get your pizza taken care of?
B:	Yeah,
B:	he has gone to get it.
B:	Thank you
B:	Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing
B:	and that's the day my husband,  wants to .
A:	Well, do you know,
A:	I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked
A:	and that's SISTERS.
A:	Have you watched that?
B:	No,
B:	but I saw that advertised today
B:	and it sounds like it's not fluff.
B:	It sounds like it's good.
A:	It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what they said it was kind of,  a little more drama to it.
A:	But it's a,
A:	So far it, I've watched it about three times now
A:	and it's really held my attention.
A:	It's been pretty good. Some,  pretty good acting.
B:	Well, and  and another one now that it's getting darker
B:	and you are wanting to cocoon more,
B:	that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
B:	Some of these,  that are nostalgic.
A:	Now I watched,  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,
B:	Did you,  like it?
A:	but I haven't,
A:	I did.
A:	I liked it.
B:	Did you?
B:	Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know
B:	and,
A:	Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet.
B:	I haven't seen it either.
B:	I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start,  something new.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's nearly,  too late for T V.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's the way I am.
A:	I get in,  from work
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm tired
A:	and I sit and watch for a few minutes
A:	so I have to get up and do dinner,  and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's like,  we are kind of,   tuned out of our T V.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's us.
A:	If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we do too.
A:	But there are some good shows on.
A:	I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I like,
A:	I don't know
A:	I, I'm always in to making things
A:	and,  And I don't just spend all my time,
B:	I don't know,
B:	yeah.
B:	There's a lot more to do with,  with your time when you get into it.
A:	and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.
B:	They don't have children yet,
B:	and they just turn it on when they walk in,
B:	they turn it off when they leave.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So they are used to that too.
A:	I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I understand.
B:	Same here.
A:	But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,
A:	and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's real good.
B:	And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,  you know, talk shows.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I like her.
A:	I never get in in time for any of those.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.
B:	I guess we've kind of exhausted this one,
B:	but it's nice talking with you.
A:	Well, it's nice talking with you.
B:	Thank you.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, I guess it's, uh,
A:	watching the the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime.
A:	In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around
A:	and well, I, I,
B:	Oh, gracious.
A:	they've caught them
A:	and they, they're in there.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders?
B:	There was that, uh,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was really on the national news a lot.
B:	We heard a lot about that in Texas.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So that's,
A:	well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin
A:	so I kind of get both, both news
A:	and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped, and killed her
B:	Oh.
A:	and they are not too happy about that now, I guess,
A:	so.
B:	Well, I can imagine.
A:	There .
B:	It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me.
B:	I, I don't know.
B:	I don't know if statistically they are
B:	but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news
B:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, that's hard to say for sure.
A:	I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity
A:	and, They, they get their names in the, in the paper
B:	You wonder about that sometimes.
A:	and they become big celebrities.
A:	But,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's kind of scary.
B:	I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories.
B:	Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas.
A:	Well, uh, I know one I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right?
B:	Yes,
B:	we do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do you have it up there?
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	I see.
A:	See I, I
B:	Do you think that's a deterrent?
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it
A:	but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's,
A:	and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem,
B:	and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, they are really in a crisis.
B:	There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And a lot of them they put out on parole
B:	and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses
B:	and, the crime rate is the worst than ever before.
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes
A:	than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people
A:	and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes.
B:	I think that could be true too.
A:	Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh,
B:	I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again
A:	Yeah.
B:	And to me that's really scary.
B:	Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer.
A:	If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V the, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	They think it's okay thing to do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's a very good point.
B:	You know, I,
B:	there's a lot more working mothers, a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing.
B:	Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore.
B:	And,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, a lot of the European countries, uh, they tend to sensor,
A:	well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they have a lot less crime.
B:	Huh.
A:	Some of, some of those European countries are, are, you can leave your, your, uh, doors open and, and, and be safe.
A:	Uh, even, uh, I think New Zealand is one of, one of the places, uh, that,
B:	Well, Sid,
B:	have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for, for your next vehicle?
A:	Well, I don't know if I really have a, a lot of, uh, requirements.
A:	Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the best deal.
A:	Uh, that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and, and give me a good price.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess.
B:	Uh, I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a personal mover. Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway or, or local mileage more often.
B:	And, uh, hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I'm, I'm real picky.
B:	if you are going to keep something that long, you know, you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know,
A:	even if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh, you are going to get some good life out of it.
A:	Uh, my, my Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty thousand
A:	and it's still in pretty good shape.
A:	Uh, there was a flaw in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke,
A:	and it cost me some bucks to, to fix that
A:	but that was, you know, something that was unforeseen.
A:	But I still think I I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then.
A:	Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but, uh, but not FROM PASADENA
A:	But, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I, I baby them as much as I possibly can.
A:	Uh, it's a pretty big expense nowadays.
A:	Uh, and I guess I like to take care of it, uh,
A:	so I don't have to buy one too often.
B:	That's true.
B:	Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in your fleet?
B:	Uh, do you have a family fleet
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury that, uh, doesn't want to die on me
A:	so I, I just keep running the thing. Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits,
A:	but it just doesn't seem to want to.
A:	I'll probably have, uh, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die.
B:	Well, that may be.
B:	They, Chrysler made some really good old engines back then
B:	like the, the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine.
A:	Oh. I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler
A:	but it runs good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new Plymouth Voyager.
B:	It's only a, a couple of years old.
B:	But that's the second one of, of those that we've had,
B:	and that's the, the family travel vehicle.
B:	You know, not only does it do all the, the, uh, carpooling around during the week,
B:	but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in.
B:	I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the, the vehicle a lot.
B:	Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff. Just because I can't see, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm to, my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle  that's in front of me.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle.
A:	Uh, I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times
A:	and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around.
A:	I just feel that,
A:	So, so what have you seen lately that, um, you think is worthwhile?
B:	Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY.
B:	Have you seen that yet?
A:	No,
A:	I, I saw the previews.
B:	It's really good.
B:	I loved it.
B:	Um, it's, um.
A:	Does, does he, does it have a happy ending,
A:	or.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really good ending
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B:	I generally don't get into movies that much,
B:	but I saw that one,
B:	and then before that one, I saw, um, oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF.
A:	Oh, that was funny, wasn't it
B:	Yeah,
B:	did you, have you seen that one?
A:	Yes,
A:	and, and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it
A:	Yes.
B:	But it was silly.
A:	Right.
A:	So, now these are for two very different movies.
A:	One, one, uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes.
A:	Um, my most recent, um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH.
A:	I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's been out for a couple of years,
A:	but. Have you seen that?
B:	I haven't seen that yet.
A:	Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play,
A:	and it's beautifully done.
A:	Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit
A:	and there might be a word or two changed.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie
B:	Um. Such as
A:	um, and I like, as you know, these, these, these silly movies,
A:	and I also like just some strange movies.
A:	Do you have any.
A:	Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER.
A:	Um, but there are also these various, um, David Lynch movies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS.
A:	That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	I haven't seen any of those.
A:	Oh.
A:	Um well, I don't, I don't especially recommend,
B:	They're really good?
A:	I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing,
A:	you have to like,
A:	did you see TWIN PEAKS?
B:	Huh-uh,
B:	no.
A:	No,
A:	so, okay.
A:	So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're, they're just strange.
B:	Are they, I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense
A:	Well, uh. I think suspense is the right word.
B:	or,
A:	Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric
A:	and, uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too.
B:	Oh really.
A:	That was the television show.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies.
A:	Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY.
A:	Um, but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, um, um,
A:	what, what are the titles,
A:	I can't remember the titles any more. But, some really weird ones, uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters.
A:	Um, it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal.
B:	Right.
B:	So do you like, um, movies a lot?
B:	See I don't do,
B:	I don't.
A:	I do, I do like movies a lot.
B:	Right.
B:	See, I don't do that,
B:	I don't go to movies that often,
B:	but, just recently I've been to a couple
A:	Do, do you rent them,
A:	or.
B:	Um, no,
B:	we, I just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally,
A:	Yes.
B:	but, I don't know,
B:	I just, I usually fall asleep
B:	or I get bored pretty easily
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what my wife does too, um,
A:	I mean, she falls asleep
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	that's exactly right.
A:	Well, well it was good talking to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's good to talk to you, too.
A:	Take care.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	did they tell you our topic?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	somebody else answered the phone and put my number in.
A:	Okay,
A:	it's, uh,
B:	Uh, what is the topic?
A:	The topic is cars.
A:	What kind of car will you buy next
A:	and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac.
A:	Okay.
B:	I've had, uh,
B:	well, I'm on my third one.
B:	And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm the same way.
A:	I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs.
A:	I went to my first Lincoln this last time.
A:	I travel
A:	and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company
A:	so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I finally tried one after fifty years
B:	My,
A:	and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars,
A:	but I bought a Lincoln
A:	and I like it.
B:	My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years,
B:	but I've always been a G M man.
B:	I'm in the auto parts business myself.
A:	Oh, are you?
B:	And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I just love it to death.
B:	I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it.
A:	Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman.
A:	I travel on the road
A:	so I like a little heavier car
A:	but,
B:	I used to do that quite a bit myself.
A:	So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I tell you what,
A:	I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	because I like the Lincoln
A:	but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better.
B:	They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better.
A:	I think so, too.
B:	And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products
B:	and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash
B:	and, and the, the buttons are so small to push
A:	Yeah,
A:	they really do.
B:	and G M doesn't seem to do that.
B:	I kind of like that feature,
B:	so.
A:	You know, I'm a funny duck
A:	that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.
A:	I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.
A:	They always appear to hold well.
B:	I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up.
A:	Did you.
B:	And I had them do all four wheels.
A:	And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is,
A:	a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car
A:	and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln
A:	and they're just not as large as before.
A:	I do miss that.
B:	That's true,
B:	yeah.
B:	But, what is big today.
A:	Well, you're right.
B:	You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's big,
A:	but the trunk space for me, uh,
A:	what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car
A:	and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough.
B:	You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now, I have the Town Car
A:	and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac.
B:	Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh,
B:	or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	You know, straight across.
B:	I mean,
A:	They went all the way down?
B:	Front to back.
A:	Well, that's good.
B:	Not going from side to side.
A:	That's good.
B:	And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items,
A:	I sell guns, gun cases and things like that
B:	I see.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I need to, you know,
A:	that's about the same size as a golf club.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that
A:	and,
B:	I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental.
A:	Nope.
B:	Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car
A:	Right.
B:	because it's a V Six,
B:	but it, uh,
B:	I I drove it from here to Memphis
B:	and I really enjoyed driving that car.
B:	If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville.
A:	I usually fly.
A:	I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me.
A:	We drove it ten hours to Nashville,
A:	and it, it handled real well,
A:	but, my main thing is space,
A:	so if a Continental,
A:	I might consider it the next time,
A:	a Continental has more trunk space.
B:	You might take a look at them.
B:	They, they had a, a lot more trunk space.
B:	As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had.
A:	You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs?
B:	Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like leather interiors also.
B:	Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather
B:	and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it
B:	and my Allante has, uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing.
A:	That's a nice car.
A:	You bet,
A:	and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus,
A:	Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers.
B:	Is it?
B:	I'd have to agree with that.
B:	They are my favorite team, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	A little disappointing the last few years.
A:	I'm telling you.
A:	You think they'll sign Ruben?
B:	You know I really don't.
A:	No?
B:	I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra
B:	and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players.
B:	Oh, I do, too.
B:	I just,
A:	I think that's going to be the big problem.
B:	The main thing,
B:	It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	We just can't seem to, you know,
B:	I think we've been in this spot,
B:	I think we finished second once or maybe even twice.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just, it's just too disappointing.
B:	I just watch them fall every year.
A:	Right.
B:	I was a Pete Incaviglia fan
B:	and, uh I liked him,
A:	Oh.
B:	but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just,
B:	decisions like that have to be made by someone
B:	Glad it's not me making them.
A:	Right
A:	I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.
A:	But,
B:	They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, and that's the name of the game, too.
B:	You got to make money. You know, pay these players so much money,
A:	Right.
B:	now, it's just it's frightening.
A:	Right.
B:	You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that.
A:	That's true.
A:	But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need.
A:	Because they've got the hitting,
A:	but they need the pitching.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they really do.
A:	Um.
B:	I think they, uh, I think they need them all.
B:	I just don't I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities
B:	and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store,
A:	Oh, I know.
B:	but, I realize the difference,
B:	but, I just don't understand,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	I tell you.
A:	It's real aggravating,
A:	but,
B:	But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them
B:	because I tell you, we need a winner in this town.
B:	It looks like our Cowboys are coming back
B:	but, So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas,
A:	That's right.
B:	but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh the soccer team.
A:	It's always got,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area,
A:	but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	It's,
A:	Just real aggravating to
A:	because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here,
A:	so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven,
A:	so it's a lot of losers
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know.
B:	I've been one,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four
B:	and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time
B:	and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean I follow them
B:	and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys,
B:	but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it.
B:	I mean, it, You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that stadium.
A:	Right.
A:	I'm telling you.
B:	I love Nolan Ryan.
B:	I guess you probably love him, too.
A:	Right,
A:	I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team.
B:	Oh, I do, too.
A:	I mean, It would be packed.
A:	And they got that new stadium they are building.
A:	So, at least, at least that will be exciting when we get that,
B:	It will.
A:	but,
B:	Well, where do you think they are heading this year?
A:	Uh, it's hard to say.
A:	It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra
A:	and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer,
B:	Right
A:	and, man, that's getting old, you know.
A:	These guys have been pampered.
A:	I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever
A:	And,
B:	and they have the later ten game winning streak
A:	Right.
B:	and they give him all kinds of money
B:	and then he just goes right down the tubes.
A:	And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old.
A:	But I like this Sandy Johnson.
A:	Hello.
B:	Yes,
B:	I forgot we had to hit one
B:	Our time will be up.
A:	Well, I hit one and nothing happened.
A:	What's going on?
B:	Well, just go ahead and talk,
B:	that's all.
A:	Are you sure?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Don't they usually tell you to say something?
B:	I don't think so.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden.
B:	Yes,
B:	I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden.
A:	What do I do?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I, uh, I cut it occasionally.
B:	Good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	you're ahead of me.
A:	Is, uh, is that good?
A:	Okay.
B:	That's better.
A:	And I edge it occasionally.
B:	Oh, that's really good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, am I good, or what?
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, Uh, much beyond that I don't do
B:	I don't do any of that.
B:	Really,
B:	well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, he is going to build you a fence.
B:	Well, he's giving me an estimate.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it.
A:	What, for a fence?
A:	Oh, well, I thought, isn't he the same one?
B:	he is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but ten dollars, or what what does he charge, not even that.
B:	What does he charge me?
A:	Well, my,
A:	I don't know.
B:	It's like next to nothing.
B:	it's ten because I,
B:	it's forty a month.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds.
B:	Well, he won't pull weeds.
B:	He says he'll spray them,
B:	but he won't pull them.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he's right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	But he just says to keep spraying them so,
A:	Well so,
B:	Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me
B:	so that was real,
A:	Yeah,
A:	so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately?
B:	No.
B:	No.
B:	There are two out front
B:	I thought I'd grab one of these days,
B:	but I haven't bothered as I walk on by.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds
B:	and there was dog dirt in it
A:	Oh, oh, goody.
B:	and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
B:	and I left the whole thing
B:	and  that was about a month ago.
A:	I thought you were going to say there  I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds
B:	I would rather a snake,
B:	no
A:	Oh, God, oh
B:	I just left the whole thing.
B:	The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I haven't gone back over there.
B:	It really made me mad.
A:	Oh, God.
B:	So anyway but,
A:	But, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted?
A:	Did they die or what?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	now they died.
A:	Oh, they're all,
A:	so they, oh,
A:	are they going to come back in the spring?
B:	I don't know.
A:	Oh.
B:	I don't know,
B:	and then I got some nice, uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas,
B:	then they started to die, too.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, I don't think any of it comes back
B:	but I don't know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	maybe these,
B:	sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to.
A:	I don't know, uh,
B:	So,
A:	Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	They're the best kind.
A:	Yeah
A:	they, They're really pretty.
B:	They, they're like indestructible.
B:	They really grow nice
B:	and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back,
B:	but lots of times they do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah
B:	We'll see.
B:	They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes?
B:	But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.
A:	We didn't disconnect, did we
B:	I hope not
B:	Neither one of us is getting paid for this.
A:	Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid
B:	Yeah,
B:	really,
B:	I know it.
B:	I can't believe this.
B:	I got somebody from Utah and somebody,
A:	What?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	where was the person last night was from far away.
A:	You're kidding?
A:	Really?
B:	And we get each other down the street.
B:	This is so funny.
A:	Well, the, uh,
A:	I, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas
A:	and that was it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had Dallas, Arlington.
B:	I've had, uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose  son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, uh, another state,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wow.
A:	Really?
B:	I can't remember,
B:	but she told me about the Utah Jazz,
B:	we talked about basketball.
A:	Oh, really
B:	And I don't remember what, what the place was last night,
B:	but I'm thinking Colorado,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I'm not sure
B:	I'd know the place, anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	I don't know,
B:	But mostly they're from the area.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It,
A:	Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.
B:	Not for me.
A:	Not for me either.
B:	You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds.
A:	What do I,
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I don't, you know,
A:	I, what do I do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it
A:	and that's about it.
B:	I know.
A:	What do I do with it?
B:	I know,
B:	we're not typical Texans.
A:	No.
A:	What's going on,
A:	are they going to tell us to stop or what
B:	I don't know,
B:	I hope so.
B:	Come on,
B:	come on.
A:	Isn't it five minutes?
B:	I don't know.
A:	I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens.
B:	I know.
B:	Well, we can talk about something else.
B:	It's just a suggested topic.
A:	Oh, oh, it's just suggested?
B:	So, how's the baby, do you think
A:	What?
B:	How's the,
A:	We could talk, Let's talk about the baby.
B:	Let's talk about the baby.
A:	Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?
B:	Yeah,
B:	our budgeting plan includes me getting a job
B:	We're, we're at the point now,
B:	I I quit working about six months ago to start this house
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm out of cash
B:	and I'm not out of project yet.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work.
B:	As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate.
B:	Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes.
B:	So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then.
B:	But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,
B:	we always put ten percent back,
B:	and that's a never touch.
A:	Uh, into savings.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	Either savings or investment, one of the two,
B:	but we don't ever put it in a high risk.
B:	It's just always going to be there.
A:	Well, that's pretty good.
B:	And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,
B:	we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food
A:	Boy, that's pretty good.
B:	and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.
B:	And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate.
B:	I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that,
A:	Sure.
B:	but, uh, we're still making the payments on them.
B:	It's just, when you,
B:	see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home  and do it yourself.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's tough here too.
A:	You have to have the contractor sign with you.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it
B:	Yeah.
A:	, where I live, that is.
B:	And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the bank can eat the contractor.
A:	Oh, bad for him, huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	bad for him.
B:	But, the homeowner can't be touched.
A:	Um.
B:	It's a homestead state.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	see right now if I quit paying any of my bills,
B:	the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.
B:	They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period.
A:	Wow.
B:	You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything
B:	that's not the tools of your trade,
B:	but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.
A:	Well, that's kind of handy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pretty interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Texas has quite the history.
B:	Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know
B:	We just going to spend it all.
A:	That's kind of what we do.
A:	We, uh, we're L D S
A:	and so we pay ten percent tithing
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, and my wife doesn't work.
A:	We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt.
B:	You know, uh, we paid cash for car.
B:	Well, we bought the car on time, one of them,
B:	but we, you know, we since paid it off.
A:	Well that's pretty.
B:	The land is paid for cash,
B:	so we don't have to worry about that.
A:	That's a great position to be in.
B:	Well, it's fraught with other problems
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not very motivated
A:	Oh
A:	What kind of consulting do you do?
B:	Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm into computers, too.
A:	I I'm a E D P auditor.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh.
A:	And.
B:	You into mainframes?
A:	and P C s.
B:	oh really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm just brushing up on, well, C plus plus.
B:	Are you really?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	I just got that a few days ago.
A:	Three oh?
B:	Oh, gees,
B:	don't get me to lying.
B:	I bought it at a fire sale.
A:	Oh.
B:	This guy's place burned down,
B:	and you can't, the American government you can't trust them either, because you think, you don't know how corrupt they are. I mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and, things like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, it's the lesser of two evils,
B:	they will probably say this is the lesser of two evils.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is.
B:	But the,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they need to have more checks and balances in their government to get rid of the corruption. But I think first though,
A:	I don't know,
A:	they need to, I think they need the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their, uh, you know the atrocities that they commit and the drug dealings, and in the, just in the drug crimes,
A:	because I feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power, that you know,
A:	because there are so many of them that the next one to come up, if you just knock one off and then have another one,
A:	and I know a lot of those nations, there's, uh, Brazil, I know, is like forty percent evangelical Christian. Not just go to church but, you know, really on fire for God,
A:	and they are just surpassing America, Latin America by the drugs.
A:	You know, it's just incomprehensible,
A:	and, uh, so I just think that, I think that God is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership,
A:	and I know, the president of, I believe Costa Rica is a Christian.
A:	And he goes to, no Guatemala, because he goes to virgo church in Guatemala City.
A:	The church is in real close relationship with him.
A:	And he is a former president of Guatemala.
A:	He's an elder at virgo church
A:	and, you know that, that God is doing something
A:	and he is raising up some leaders
A:	and the people want him back as president bad,
A:	but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term
A:	and so the, the people are trying to override that, I mean not just the Christians, but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority, the people rejoice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	good.
B:	See, that's the thing,
B:	that it's going, have to,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that's the undoing of everything,
B:	and it's the,
B:	we have no morals, when we, talk about the crime and all that in the city,
B:	it's just the kids have no morals.
A:	Right.
B:	That's the thing that will eventually, you know,
B:	if anyone is going to be saved.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It is having a good moral background.
B:	And it's funny you mention Costa Rica, because they are just, they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries, in Central America.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, I was reading an article in the, uh, National Geographic
B:	and, I don't know,
B:	I don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they don't have oil or anything,
B:	and they don't have big tourism.
B:	So maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know that Costa Rica, they don't allow anybody to come that, uh, to come any, uh, what do you call, what do you call immigrants?
A:	They don't allow anything like that
A:	like I could not go to Costa Rica and live as an American citizen.
A:	They would not permit me to live there to work.
A:	They wouldn't.
A:	Their jobs are there for Costa Ricans.
A:	They don't allow people to move in, like less nations, you know,
B:	They don't, they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either.
A:	take the job.
A:	No
A:	they don't take any.
A:	I mean I couldn't even go there.
A:	My husband had to receive all this special permission to go,
A:	so even with, uh, you know, in, uh, inner company, you know, transfer, or something,
A:	and I have another friend in, uh, Costa Rica that,
A:	she was born there.
A:	She's Costa Rican.
A:	I guess I do know a little bit.
A:	I went to Mexico City one time and stayed.
A:	I have been there twice and stayed
A:	and, that, aw, that was just really sad.
A:	But, a lot of it though is their debt.
A:	I think that we should not loan them anymore money,
A:	that if we still want to give them money, give them money, quit loaning it to them.
A:	You're not going to get it back.
A:	Don't be indebted to anybody.
A:	Don't be the loaner or borrower.
A:	It's just not good.
A:	We need to, if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them,
A:	but quit loaning all the money out.
A:	Which I don't think we are loaning anymore now,
A:	but that's how we got into a problem.
A:	If we got, the,
A:	we have, we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars.
A:	That's common sense,
A:	you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back.
B:	Yeah
B:	also, uh, uh, Mexico, uh, we will loan the money in uh,
B:	a lot of the higher, the higher people, were just stealing it and, building these beautiful homes, and nice ranches and things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we are, we're suckers.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we are, it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money,
A:	that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them.
A:	You don't loan money to people like that.
A:	I mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out, fine,
A:	but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in, to people that you can just look at the situation,
B:	They know they're not going to pay it back.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and know that they are going to be capable of paying us back,
A:	and that puts a bondage on them.
A:	It makes, you know, pressure on the nation, and on the people, and on the leadership, and makes their inflation go up,
A:	and it's just a big mess.
B:	Did you go to Mexico City, uh, anywhere near when the earthquake hit.
A:	No,
A:	but I knew people,
A:	I was there before that,
A:	but I knew people,
A:	I got a letter from a friend of mine that I had met there, that who, who the apartment building was destroyed
A:	and they were living in a tent,
A:	so it's kind of weird, you know.
A:	To these people who were on U S dive, the Mexican diving, we went to the pool together, and watched them dive and all this,
A:	so they were you know, just normal people, weren't squatters or poor people or anything that, uh,
A:	I did, I knew all of my friends there,
A:	but none of them that I know of, got killed in it.
A:	But, uh, they're all Christians though.
A:	God really protected them.
A:	See that broke out a revival in Mexico City. That C B S news and A B C never told you about.
A:	There's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake, because there's a lot of, you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot, lots of witchcraft, a lot of witchcraft. A whole lot of witchcraft. So, a lot of it in the name of Christianity.
B:	Oh, I can imagine.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	There's a lot, you know
A:	they call themselves Christians,
A:	but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff, and just a whole lot of the generational things too, like the Mayans and the Incas.
A:	You can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were.
A:	And yet, they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by
A:	so many people,
A:	even now in America, you know, we wouldn't know the truth with all of Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth, because of how wicked they were.
A:	I've been down to the pyramids
A:	and I have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy,
A:	and they hold it up to the sun God,
A:	and that's pretty of heavy duty.
B:	Yeah,
B:	is, is there still blood stains on the altar
B:	or has it worn away through the years?
A:	I don't think so.
A:	The little box is black on the top of the pyramid in the sun.
A:	It's black,
A:	so
A:	yeah,
A:	you can't really tell,
A:	but it was kind of weird, you know,
A:	you think, wow there is where they did sacrifices to false Gods.
B:	Do you get spooked, you feel,
B:	or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there?
B:	Because,
A:	Uh, at that time, I kind of did.
A:	It really impressed me, just you know, feeling
A:	but I wasn't a Christian when I went there,
A:	but, uh, I think that a lot of those, those you know, generational things
A:	I think, that God sees I'm praying, you know,
A:	that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray, because that does affect that things, you know, in your background.
A:	Hi, Maureen.
A:	How are you?
B:	All right.
A:	Well do you have a family budget?
B:	No,
B:	we probably should,
B:	but we haven't.
B:	So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done, which you've found useful and workable.
A:	Okay.
A:	We do a few things,
A:	and I have to say we're, my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds.
A:	I, I'm an accountant.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, he has an M B A,
A:	so, uh, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that.
A:	So
B:	Um, okay.
A:	Um, coming from that background, what we pretty much do is we, in our household, as far as living expenses, we live on a cash budget.
A:	Every month, my husband, uh, goes to the credit union and withdraws, you know, X amount of dollars for the month,
A:	and then that money is used during that month.
A:	We have a certain budget.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, uh, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, baby-sitting, things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, excuse me, if, uh, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, uh, we don't buy any more milk
B:	Uh-huh
A:	But, uh, we've gotten pretty good at it,
A:	we've been doing it a couple of years now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, we, our budgets are realistic
A:	and they are not so stringent and, you know to make us feel uncomfortable.
B:	Hm.
A:	And I, I really try to stretch my, my dollars here and there, shopping, uh, at warehouses sometimes, like at Sam's and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget
A:	and it, sometimes it's tight come the end of the month,
A:	but generally, we always make it.
B:	What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for,
B:	the, you know are sometimes several hundred dollars, like, uh, tires for the car or car repair of some sort, or, like a, a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for?
A:	Right.
A:	Well, uh, most of our medical things, we don't, uh, have to worry about, because of insurance
A:	and they're, they're relatively small.
A:	Uh, we've been lucky.
A:	In the past we didn't have that problem
A:	but right now we don't.
A:	For the other things, the things that crop up, that we aren't really expecting, we have different funds set aside for different things.
A:	Like we have a car fund
A:	and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, I mean,
A:	and I, I can't really remember what it is.
B:	Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a different savings account
B:	or,
A:	It's all part of the savings account.
A:	We just keep track of it on paper.
A:	Uh, you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account.
A:	We decide, okay, you know, let's say it's a hundred dollars.
A:	You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. You know,
B:	Oh.
A:	Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever.
A:	Uh, and we just, we constantly do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up.
A:	Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, but, we have the money set aside,
A:	so if it does it's not going to kill us.
B:	Hm.
A:	Uh, so we're, we're actually, we're pretty disciplined,
A:	so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through.
B:	Okay,
B:	then, so like your pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, you know, will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing?
A:	Well, in.
B:	Or like what, what percent, do you then save or something?
A:	Uh, we have a lot of different things.
A:	Right now, we save about twenty-five percent of our, of our pay.
B:	Hm, okay.
A:	It, and it goes toward different things,
A:	it's for, you know, for vacations like I said, for, you know, emergencies like for car, uh, breaks down, something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and we also put money aside for our kids college.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Neither of us had any help with our college degrees,
A:	and just this last month we paid off my final school loan.
A:	So
B:	Oh.
A:	We're starting our kids a little bit early.
B:	Okay.
A:	Do you, uh, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things?
B:	Checking account a lot, uh, not so much credit cards.
A:	Sure.
B:	and so pretty much now, uh, we don't use them too much.
B:	If we travel or something, yeah. But, you know. Standard, we usually don't.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or if it, it is a purchase, uh, then it's paid off when the bill comes.
B:	You know, so it isn't any extended, uh,
B:	it may be that I picked up something at the store,
B:	but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then,
B:	so it's not any, you know, uh, build up on the charge cards at all.
A:	That's good.
B:	And, but that hasn't always been the case
B:	So, I'm kind of,
B:	I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things, uh, you know, in the past,
B:	and I don't have, you know, big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards, because that interest rate just is a killer.
A:	Oh, and it's not deductible anymore.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow.
B:	But, uh, pretty much when I always, I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We did, we did that for a long time
A:	and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things.
B:	Hm.
A:	And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget.
A:	Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we kept track of everything for a month. You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything, and from that built, you know, a cash budget.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So now, I mean, I have,
A:	I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else,
A:	and some months it may be different.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves, you know, down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing,
A:	but the way we set up, you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, you know, uh, utilities and, uh, the house payment and all that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	those are things you don't really have much control over.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, the cash budget just fits right in there
A:	like I said if we don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment.
A:	I mean, but again it's a set amount every month. And, uh, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We, we don't, we still have fun on things
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, we are in the process of trying to buy a house,
B:	do you know, how did your budget work
B:	or did you have a budget to, uh, get your down payment going to get a house?
A:	Well, no
A:	not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our first house, it was at a time where you
A:	and the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down anything.
B:	Huh.
A:	So, we got into it fairly cheaply,
A:	and then, uh, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, we, we got out of that one pretty easily
B:	Okay, uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I just keep thinking all the time
B:	I mean, it, it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, you know, your priority, at least mine is to save for the house.
B:	But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment.
B:	You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime.
A:	Sure,
A:	I know.
A:	That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education,
A:	I mean jeez, they are one and four
A:	We have got a long time to save,
A:	my husband, he's the real, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	no
B:	Well, I know,
B:	but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, you know we make X amount of money and where is it.
B:	I mean you look around
B:	and you go,  where is it,
A:	What do you do with it,
A:	I know.
B:	you, you haven't made, uh, big purchases
B:	and that's the easier thing to see,
B:	if you can see a big purchase and you go okay, well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V, or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door
B:	and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries, and stuff.
B:	That you don't have tangible, I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone, used and gone.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's amazing how much we spend on some things.
A:	My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work.
B:	Oh.
A:	And that's all he has,
A:	he has a ten dollar bill.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, I mean, so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The other times, he'll, uh, I don't know go out somewhere, eat in a cafeteria or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, but he keeps himself on that,
A:	I mean, he found it's, it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's, that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch.
B:	Yeah.
A:	When he can take a sandwich, you know.
A:	Well, how about you, are you an exercise fanatic?
B:	No.
A:	Me either
B:	I'm definitely
B:	I do like to walk.
A:	Do you?
B:	Yes.
B:	Since T I has, uh, uh, instituted that, um, walkabout, I have gone out and started walking even more, bought me the, you know, the proper shoes and everything to get started, and, uh, park out there, you know, way out there in the boondocks.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Wonderful. Uh-huh.
B:	It was so funny the other day,
B:	I took some guys to, to lunch
B:	and when we came back they said "Oh, there's a parking space real close," and I parked way out in the boonies,
A:	Way. *what is this?
B:	and I said "you can walk off your lunch."
A:	That's the way to do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm kind of like you,
A:	I've never really gotten into it,
A:	it's just a, it's just a chore, you know,
B:	Um, um. Oh.
A:	and I finally decided one semester, I'm in college and I'm taking night classes and I still don't have any of my P E classes,
A:	and so one semester I thought, okay, that's what I'm going to do
A:	and that will get me where I'll have to do it, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they were offering a, a walking class, where you, you know, you have to walk, you know, that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes, you get, you get points, you know,
B:	Um, um. Um, um.
A:	and then you have to go in once a week and log your points
A:	so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want, you know,
A:	and, at the end of the semester you go back in and your, like your final exam is a three mile walk.
B:	Oh.
A:	And if you walk it in this many minutes, you get an A,
A:	this many minutes you get a B,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, I thought, oh, this will be an easy class.
A:	and, you know, and I did it, and I did it for a long time
A:	like about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot,
B:	Oh, no.
A:	and this has been a couple of years ago,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, I had, I did that,
A:	and I just ended up having to drop the class.
B:	Oh.
A:	you know, by the time the final came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet, let alone walk three miles, you know.
B:	Oh, no.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, that was the only time I have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it, because then I had to, I had to go every week and log in what I had walked,
B:	Um, um. Right.
A:	and, my teacher looked at it every week, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, other than that I just, you know, I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile, say, okay, I'm going to start going to aerobics now, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	There you go.
A:	and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds, this is too much work.
B:	Well, you know, I have noticed too that, uh, when I started the exercise, uh, not the exercise but the walking program, uh, that I did tone up, you know, like all over,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it didn't get the upper part of my body,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, so, what I do, is I bowl.
B:	I am a fanatic when it comes to bowling,
B:	and I used to bowl five times a week,
A:	Wow.
B:	so, I really loved it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I still bowl at least once a week now, on a league, on, on a,
B:	and I'm bowling on the T I league.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, but I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor, so that every time I get up to bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel
B:	and that way I get the little extra exercise.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm always explaining to people, I do little things like that, like, you know, take the stairs instead of the, um, the elevator,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, I do silly things like that versus a, a regular program that you would have.
A:	But that's,
A:	you're amazed at how much that adds up.
B:	It sure does.
A:	I was on, uh, Nutri Systems for a while,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, that is one of the things that they really stressed doing, you know,
A:	when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking place outside the front door, park at the other end, you know,
B:	Yeah
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, and they stretched, stressed things like that too.
A:	You know, during, when you're sitting watching T V at night, during every commercial get up off the couch, go to the living room and get a glass of water, go to the bedroom and make the bed, go do something, but get up during every commercial. And, things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	There you go.
A:	And, you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up, you know, just gives you a little more activity
A:	so,
B:	That's true.
A:	especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway.
B:	No,
B:	I used to,
B:	I really did, uh, years ago
B:	and, uh, I was thinking about that not too long ago that I used to walk
B:	and not only did I walk
B:	but, I used to watch all those exercise programs on T V,
B:	and I would tape them,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then I would do them like two times a day,
B:	but I don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore.
B:	I think having children everything just kind of, everything goes by the wayside.
A:	Well, I can't use that as an excuse because I didn't do it before
A:	I had mine either.
A:	I've never been,
A:	I just, I'm more into, you know, sitting, than I am
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Me too.
A:	so, but, you know, I have found that with,
A:	I have a two year old,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I have found really though, I'm kind of the opposite, I'm more active now with him, than I was before, because now, you know, he'll "I want to go outside" and I'll go outside with him
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we'll walk up and down the street,
A:	and we'll go to the park
A:	and I'll run around with him and stuff like that,
A:	that,
A:	so I'm getting more, you know, more exercise that way than I ever did before I had him, you know.
B:	Um, um. Um, um.
A:	so, I think, I think that has helped a little bit,
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	Just chasing him around the house, you know, will be plenty for you.
B:	that's enough.
B:	Well, mine are older now, doing, uh, their own things
B:	so,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Yes,
B:	I have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old,
B:	so.
A:	Oh, lucky you,
B:	Yes.
A:	you're getting into even more interesting stages.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	We're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	you watch it'll be exactly the same
A:	Same thing, huh, it repeats, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen
B:	It does,
B:	it, it absolutely does,
B:	so.
A:	How interesting, I can hardly wait
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I know, I just know you can't.
B:	But, no,
B:	I don't get as much exercise as I used to
B:	but, I at least, since T I has implemented that program, I do,
B:	I'm more aware of it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, you know, that I'm need to do this, that and the other
B:	and, uh, so, I try to do combinations of things but not, like go down to the President's Health Club, like I see all these people do.
A:	Right.
A:	That, that walkabout's a good program.
B:	It is,
B:	it is.
A:	It really is, you know,
A:	when they first started it, I, I got all the information, of course,
A:	but just like everything else, I was real gung ho with a friend of mine,
A:	"Oh, we're going to do this, we're going to do this,"
A:	and we did do it for a long time,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then I started school, you know,
B:	Um, um.
A:	and like two nights a week I was going to school
A:	and then the other two nights a week my husband worked,
A:	so I had to pick Ryan up, you know,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	there's always an excuse, you know, to not do it
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	so,
B:	And, it gets worse,
B:	it doesn't get any better.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, I'm sure,
A:	I'm sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because I'm constantly running my children around someplace
B:	and that's where I actually get my exercise, is running them from here to there, in the car.
A:	Yeah.
A:	here to here,
A:	here,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	to the mall, to the movies, to the friends, to the,
B:	There you go,
B:	that's it,
B:	that's it.
A:	Sounds like fun.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
A:	Well, it was really good to talk to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well okay,
B:	we'll talk to you later.
A:	Take care,
A:	talk to you later.
B:	Um, um.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	So, do you fish?
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	My dad has a lake cabin,
B:	and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.
B:	It takes us about three hours to get there.
B:	And we go, and we fish,
B:	and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,
B:	but it's fun.
A:	Uh, from a boat or from shore?
B:	From the dock, from shore.
A:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	Uh, mostly catfish
A:	or,
B:	Oh, mostly we catch carp.
B:	If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.
B:	And, you know, we go ahead and eat those.
B:	But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.
B:	What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it.
B:	And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.
B:	Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there,
B:	so we don't ever catch enough to eat.
B:	Carp is usually pretty much fun.
B:	Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line.
B:	And that, that's a pretty good fight.
B:	So that's a lot of fun.
A:	Yeah.
A:	A real light line, real light rig?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that sounds like fun.
B:	They fight hard.
A:	Fish in Colorado different than that.
B:	Yeah?
A:	Mostly trout in the mountains.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and in the rivers and stuff?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	mountain streams and rivers.
B:	Are they good to eat?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	very. Yeah, very much there, you know.
B:	Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?
A:	Um, by and large, no.
A:	But, but they're big fun.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I've been,
B:	is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that
B:	or,
A:	What?
B:	Are you fly fishing
B:	or are you using a bobber?
A:	I, I, I'm a fly fisherman.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I cast a ways.
A:	I'm not highly proficient,
A:	but it's fun.
B:	I've never even tried that.
B:	My,
B:	if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble
A:	Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then.
A:	You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You're casting the weight of the line.
B:	With the little thing on the end.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well,  the fly on the end weighs nothing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I thought it had a weight.
A:	It weighs less than the line.
B:	Oh.
A:	So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you whip the line.
B:	Um.
A:	As you whip it, over your head,  or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?
A:	Well, no,
A:	no.
A:	You fish upstream.
B:	Oh, you fish upstream?
A:	Right.
A:	And then you let it carry it downstream.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then you reel it in,
A:	and you do it again.
B:	You hope that they think it's a bug and,  and eat it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Jump at it.
A:	Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.
B:	That's a fish?
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	It, it looks like a grub.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, it's a, it's a lure.
A:	Okay,
A:	whenever you, yeah,
A:	a lure, a fly.
B:	I see.
A:	Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.
B:	Oh.
A:	All right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns there's excuse me. Uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh,
B:	Did someone just come up with this design,
B:	and, and you're going to make one for yourself,
A:	Uh,
B:	or are you going to buy it?
A:	You can buy them.
A:	Uh, I've got some.
A:	And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year,
B:	huh?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Um.
A:	You know how that changes, the phase of the moon
A:	and,
B:	I guess so.
B:	We tend to use just bait. And, a few lures,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, You see, I'm from west Texas.
B:	but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.
B:	Oh, are you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Where are you from?
A:	Lubbock.
B:	Oh, I'm from Midland.
A:	Oh, another west Texan.
B:	I went to college at Tech,
B:	so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've been up there.
A:	It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.
B:	I didn't catch anything,
B:	but I've been up there
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's fun.
B:	It's lazy.
B:	Take a picnic lunch.
B:	I used to do that with my dad.
B:	Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day. Before it got too hot.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we do most of our fishing at night.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Just from the heat of it all.
B:	That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.
A:	It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.
B:	It does?
B:	I've only been up there once.
B:	In the summer. Well,
B:	no,
B:	I've been up there twice in the summer.
B:	But both times it was really pleasant.
B:	In fact, it snowed on us in, in, gosh, when was that?
A:	June?
B:	We were in Mesa Verde Park,
B:	and it was like the end of It was just before July fourth.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees.
B:	We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better
B:	And here it went and it froze,
B:	and it snowed on us.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We did not know what to do about it.
A:	Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.
A:	It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,  hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and,  seeing the squirrels and,  camping out, and eating out,  of doors
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	Do you have to,
B:	do you wear waders when you fish?
A:	Uh, I probably ought to.
A:	I just freeze.
B:	Oh.
B:	Goodness, it must be a little bit cold.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, you know,  ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there.
B:	That's cold water around there.
B:	Um. Do you have any,
A:	You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,  out there,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	and you know how it is.
A:	The water's kind of,
B:	Yeah.
B:	And you get, you get a little more carried away with it,
B:	and you move a little closer.
A:	And then you're in to it just a little bit,
A:	and then you splash in
A:	and,  the next thing you know, your knees are wet.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you have any kids that you take fishing?
A:	Uh, got a stepdaughter.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She's real sweet.
A:	And, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not.
B:	Yeah.
A:	A fuzzy little dog.
B:	I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.
A:	Oh.
B:	And the little one, of course, is, could care less.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The, uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,
B:	we got him a little pole last year,
B:	and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up
B:	That was what he considered fishing
B:	This year, he's gotten to where he can.
B:	We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm,
B:	and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And he started trying to cast it.
B:	So, he, he was kind of getting there
B:	but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now
A:	Yeah,
A:	you guys sure want to be out of range.
B:	He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.
A:	It takes time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?
A:	Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.
A:	And we still had a good time out,  of the deal.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	My husband would like to live there,
B:	but I don't know. All of our family is here
B:	so,
A:	Well, and you've got to have,
A:	you've got to work for a living.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	but T I is up there,
B:	so that part of it would probably work out
A:	What division you all in?
B:	I'm sorry, what?
A:	What division are you all in?
B:	We're both, uh,
B:	I was, uh, military,
B:	but he's division three.
B:	It goes back and forth.
B:	Division, well,
B:	maybe division one right now.
B:	He's in computers.
A:	Oh.
B:	So,
A:	Well, the only thing up here,  is division one.
B:	And he's in school,  and everything else.
B:	I have some friends who work up there.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Kathy and Kevin Guy.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And they like to fish.
B:	They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer.
B:	Her dad has a cabin,
B:	and they go fishing, up there.
A:	Oh, fishing's,  fishing is fun up here.
B:	So that would be neat to,  try it some time.
A:	It's not,
A:	It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.
A:	But it is fun.
B:	Yeah,
A:	You know,  The, the experience is, is better up here, I think.
B:	long as you have a good time, that's the main point
B:	so,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.
B:	Definitely more to look at.
A:	And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.
B:	We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.
B:	And we figured we were up a long way off.
B:	And then it rained that night,
B:	and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are?
B:	And we got up the next day,
B:	and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away
B:	And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch.
B:	So, that was kind of funny.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just love the way it looks.
B:	I could almost just watch the
B:	we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,
B:	and if you were there. I mean,
B:	it was,
B:	one time we were there,
B:	and I guess it was late May,
B:	so it was really your spring almost,  you know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,
B:	and the creek was just wild, just running.
B:	And, and all the white water and noise and the,
B:	it was just beautiful.
A:	Yeah.
A:	it gets foamy almost.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
A:	Okay, um,
A:	I have two children
A:	and they're older now,
A:	but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home
A:	and that's what I looked for
A:	and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school,
A:	and that worked.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that worked out real well
A:	but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and,  and be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that would prepare them for school also, it's real important ,  that they do that, um, that they get that preparation for school,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so
A:	but I had,
A:	I have switched schools several times because I, I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.
A:	I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, um,
B:	that, that's,
B:	oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the kids.
A:	Yeah,
A:	for the for the kids.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	well, I'm just recently married.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon
A:	Okay.
B:	but I think, um, that I, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh,
B:	I think, um, I'm lucky though that, um, my wife will probably not have to work while our children,  are under four,  or five.
A:	Oh.
A:	Wonderful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm a college professor,
A:	Oh,
B:	so,
A:	great.
B:	and that's also,
B:	and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week,  and then one or two evenings,  so that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.
A:	Um.
A:	Great.
A:	Oh that's, wonderful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,
A:	That's wonderful.
B:	I can even teach on Saturdays and,  and things, like that.
A:	Oh,
A:	great,
B:	Yeah,
B:	um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding, uh, child care,
A:	Right.
B:	and one of the things they made in, um, uh,
B:	real
B:	they're number one priority was that, um, they're children didn't have to leave their home *transcript error--spelling of initial "they're" should be "their"
A:	Oh, that's,  wonderful too,
B:	So,  they, um, um,
B:	my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, she is
B:	I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position and got it.
B:	So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess
B:	and even though she took off two years for, um,
B:	I guess four years all together,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it would be three years,
B:	how old's Kayla
B:	three, yeah,
B:	I guess she took off three years all together, um, for cause I guess they have a four year old,
B:	and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I guess she took off three all together
B:	and then when she decided to go back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home.
A:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think they were really lucky there,
B:	but I think they've lost this woman she she will not continue.
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.
A:	Sure,
A:	yeah.
B:	So I don't know what they are going to do.
A:	Oh, you know that's an ideal situation,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but not many people can afford,  something like,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think,  I think they they're both, they were both professionals unlike me they're, um, they were married, my brother's five years younger then she is,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a,  in a practice almost. Um, where, you know, he then they waited a couple years
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty twenty-six
B:	so by that time she was so well established, you know,  I guess it made it a lot easier.
A:	Right.
A:	Sure.
B:	but, uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is,  if you have that, that professional occupation where you can change.
A:	Oh, I do to.
A:	Oh, yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, uh,  lucky, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's true, yeah.
A:	uh, because I'm a single parent,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I, uh, you know, my husband and I, ex-husband and I got a divorce, um, when the children were small
A:	and so I, uh, was a teacher
A:	I, uh, still am teacher,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what I wanted,  where I could,  have piece of mind and when I taught school * transcriber spelling error--"piece" should be "peace"
B:	Yep.
B:	Yeah,
A:	and I knew my kids were being taken,  care of.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it,  I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and,  that's it .
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	that,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and when, I guess when they're five,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.
A:	Right.
B:	They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C
B:	and I think that's so funny because, um, I don't, I don't know if I want
A:	Sure.
B:	and I,
B:	it's a very important part of your life
B:	and I hope to read with my kids,
B:	but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school. At four,  or three,
A:	Well.
A:	I agree with that.
B:	you know, I can see that when you make that point.
A:	Well, the thing is,  I teach this grade and I, I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other,  children
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically,  because they were not, they're should be, there's to many things in their way, *to should be too
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and so I want my
A:	I wanted my children
A:	and they did learn to get, to get along with other people.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's a really important point.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults
A:	and I bet if we trace back to their,  early childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with,  people.
B:	Yep.
B:	I think that's really, that's important
B:	I, I've seen the same thing
B:	I, I think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone
B:	or
B:	before I was married I went out with a girl,
B:	and you know, um, boy, after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I bet,
B:	and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know, being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old,  and never, always being a bit snippy and spiteful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I bet you could trace all the way back
A:	I bet you could too,  because it, you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or,  successful adults I should say,
B:	That's true,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, really
A:	but, uh, it is a big problem
A:	and you I have lot of friends right now that, uh, have young children
A:	and they daily have problems with, with whoever is taking care of the child,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.
B:	Yep,
B:	that's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's really true.
A:	So you need,
A:	cause you need that consistency when they're young like that,
A:	and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children,  your wife gets to stay home,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would have, have given anything if I would have been able,  to stay home with my children.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you.
B:	Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.
A:	Right.
B:	I teach a computer classes
B:	so,  it's, it's one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor
A:	Oh, great.
B:	and I'm also, um, you know,
B:	they have vocational type courses on weekends,  almost everywhere,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday,  which means,  that, you know, whole week's worth of courses
A:	Oh, that's,  wonderful.
B:	so that lets you be available three days during the week,  you know,
A:	Oh, great.
B:	so you be will home with your kids I you know
B:	it's really funny is that I, I picked this career when I was in college because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um,  wanting to spend more time with my children,  because my dad had very, um, nine to five type job,  with, uh, forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five commute home,
A:	Um.   You're very wise.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, by the time he got home he was so tired
B:	and he was all rung out from the day,
A:	Sure.
B:	and I think he, he missed a lot of, um, our up bringing.
A:	Sure.
B:	You know, my mother
B:	I, I came from a family, that my mother stayed home until we started school.
A:	Uh-huh.  thirteen and a sixteen year old.
B:	Um, and I, I don't, uh,
B:	It's probably costing you a fortune.
A:	Oh it is,
A:	they really are expensive,
A:	yeah.
B:	My goodness, if, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill.
A:	Exactly.
B:	um,
A:	Well, and they
A:	most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that you know an older, older, older, truck
A:	so I can afford it,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, you know, I, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car,  drove in carpools all over the place
B:	Carpools, uh,
A:	and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere,  something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my parents did a lot of that.
B:	That's right.
B:	Yep.
B:	And just to save you trips to and from,  you know, uh, ball games and athletic events,  and activities at the school.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly.
A:	Right.
A:	That's right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	isn't that something how, you know, you think about child care
B:	and it lasts along time. *along a long
A:	It, does for ever.
B:	It, it lasts a long time.
A:	And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren,
A:	so
A:	It's not ending is it
A:	You think we've talked a long, a long enough time?
A:	Oh, they come in, see this is the first time I've done this.
A:	Oh, in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.
B:	Well, you don't have to
B:	but they,  they,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, you go the length
B:	and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes.
A:	Oh.
B:	Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.
A:	I see.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I see.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Are you from the,
A:	where are you from?
B:	This is Baltimore, Maryland.
A:	Oh, my gosh, I'm from, uh, Plano, Texas which is, which is outside of Dallas.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, most of most of the people I talk to are from Texas.
A:	Yeah
A:	because that's where T I is
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	and I've discussed,  I've discussed, um.
A:	That makes sense.
A:	Okay.
A:	Guess we can go ahead.
A:	Uh, well, I guess you know it's, you know,
A:	since living in Dallas it's always so hot, so in the summertime, I just, I wear lots of shorts, so because I don't work during the day.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, do you work?
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I do work.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, and,
B:	but I work at a manufacturing plant,
B:	so I wear a lot of blue jeans,  and T-shirts.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress,  and high heel shoes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I feel really uncomfortable doing that
B:	and,  in the plant so, uh, it's, it's a problem for me.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Very, very, comfortable.
B:	I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and buying suits and stuff, yeah, because just being at home
A:	and, I work at home,
A:	so,  I just have, you know, I just wear my, you know, my shorts and stuff like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't go out and spend lots of money on, uh, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But when I,
A:	before I got married, you know, I was working
A:	so I, uh, you know, I had more suits and stuff then
A:	but,
B:	Right
A:	Worry about all that kind of stuff
B:	Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working,  uh, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, but occasionally I have to because, uh, part of my job is teaching,  and training,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal,  garb
A:	When you're training, right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Than your normal garb
B:	But I'm like you, too, uh, I moved from Ohio down to here
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	moved from,  Winter.
B:	and I had mostly polyesters and,  wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's really,
B:	that's been a problem for me.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because I came from Wyoming
A:	and I had wool suits and wool skirts
A:	and, You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear,  because you can't wear them here.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, the seasons are just so much different.
A:	You have so much summer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so then when I, you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear
B:	That's true, that's true.
A:	Yeah
B:	Well, I know, I was just now, uh, uh, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I was going through here
B:	and I was thinking, I haven't worn this in three years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, because it's a wool skirt
B:	and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I have five or six wool skirts,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,
B:	but no, I folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year
A:	Yeah.
A:	You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.
A:	So,
B:	Well, I know last year, uh, well, this past winter, it wasn't that cold.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But the previous winter we had more, uh, cold weather where I was able to actually wear,  your double and triple layerings of, uh, clothes yeah, like you would when you're up north.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Clothes,
A:	yeah.
B:	So  that's really interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and I, I just don't spend, you know,
A:	right now my clothes come from Target, you know
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
B:	yes,
B:	and they're all one hundred percent cotton
B:	and
A:	Yes,
A:	and they,
A:	you take them out of the drier
A:	and they're wadded up in a ball.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
B:	I know.
A:	Oh
A:	I'm so glad to meet somebody that, that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house.
B:	It is, it is.
A:	You know, I have very little furniture,
A:	but my ironing board is part of my decor
A:	so,
B:	That's true,
B:	and, and I've been looking at these, uh, uh, like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got, that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh, uh, what, the, the, the door.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh,
B:	and then you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it,  permanently attached,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom
B:	and it's just, it's just an eyesore, I think,  with all the,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, yeah
A:	it is, it is,
A:	but it's like, uh, I just don't want to do it
B:	Uh-uh,
B:	uh-uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	No.
B:	I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet,  and, and running, you know, a line in there for my iron so I could do it in there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore
A:	Yeah
A:	that's an idea.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I have a big closet.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, you know,
A:	if I have,
A:	if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room,  I will put it away,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
A:	but I iron our clothes as we go along,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, you know,
B:	I no longer do that weekly thing,  because I have so many,
A:	Right,
A:	no.
B:	and I'm like you,  I, the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because it's too many,
B:	hundred percent cotton.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You can't iron it all
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And then with my kids, they're always getting into, you know,
A:	they can't decide what they want to wear so they,  change their minds, you know, I know, I mean my oldest is only four,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but she's still changes her mind two or three times,  before she figures out what she's going to wear
B:	Right.
A:	so,
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, I know, I know.
A:	And then they never put anything back.
B:	No,
B:	no
B:	of course not.
B:	No,
B:	that, uh, that would be too simple.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Absolutely not
B:	That's right.
A:	Our lot in life is to make her life miserable
A:	so,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	absolutely, absolutely.
A:	Uh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's,
A:	it's been good talking to you, to see somebody, hear somebody that does the same thing I do because I tell people what I do
A:	and they just go, oh, how do you do that?
A:	It's like, it's easy, you just do it, you know.
B:	That's right
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh,
B:	but, yeah,
B:	I, uh, I know several of my girlfriends, though, we, uh, we all keep our ironing boards out and just, uh, an ever present thing in our household
B:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there, you know.
A:	My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes.
B:	There you go.
A:	You know.
B:	Things that need to be mended,  things that have to get ironed,
A:	Yeah.
A:	He wouldn't know where to put things
A:	so,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
A:	Yeah
A:	so,
B:	Oh, well, it was nice talking with you.
A:	Oh, it was nice talking with you, too.
B:	Okay,
B:	take care.
A:	Take care.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	bye-bye.
B:	So eating out.
B:	What are you interested in in restaurants?
A:	Right, uh.
A:	So.
B:	Uh, once a week, twice a week?
A:	Oh, at least once a week.
A:	We're, we're retired now.
A:	When we working out we ate out more than that
B:	Yeah,
B:	I understand.
B:	Uh, but we both work
B:	and we have a daughter,
B:	and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway.
A:	Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?
B:	Uh, really, I'm kind of open on food.
B:	I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer.
B:	I'll, uh, try anything once.
A:	Right.
B:	Been on a real barbecue kick lately.
A:	Oh have you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	We like Chinese.
A:	We eat, a lot of Chinese food.
B:	Excuse me. Uh, yeah,
B:	we usually have Chinese once a month.
A:	What do you look for in a restaurant?
B:	I hate franchised restaurants.
A:	You what?
A:	You,
B:	I despise franchised restaurants.
A:	Oh I,
B:	I, I, I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run. Uh, some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost.
A:	Right.
A:	I know what you mean.
A:	I like some ambiance,
A:	and I like good food.
A:	I don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that.
B:	I don't,
B:	but I don't like something fake or put on either.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I don't know why that is.
B:	I think it's probably due to pricing, often.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really with high prices
B:	Yeah.
A:	and seven courses isn't what I usually look for
B:	It is what you look for?
B:	Oh, isn't, isn't.
B:	Uh, I try to get my money's worth.
A:	Right
B:	And not just that, I try to, well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth. You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and, and flavor and texture and care.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Presentation
A:	and,
B:	Well, presentation's not always all of it either.
A:	Well, like we, we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently,
B:	It's, it's important.
A:	and we're trying to give them a little patronage.
A:	But Sunday we went there,
A:	and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	something a little extra
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what I mean by,
B:	and just for color if nothing else.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican.
A:	Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex.
B:	Yeah,
B:	home cooked Tex-Mex.
B:	Uh, Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation.
A:	Right,
A:	I know.
A:	Uh, we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,
A:	and we've really gotten to like,
A:	we like the real Mexican food better than Tex-Mex.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, there's real Mexican food
B:	and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican, you know, by third or fourth generation Americans of Hispanic heritage.
A:	Right.
A:	It's all pretty good, isn't it?
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	and, and there's big differences, of course,
B:	and, of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food, in because its regional, too.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	that's true.
B:	So.
A:	I'm originally from Maine,
A:	so we like seafood, too.
A:	And that's something we don't get here,
A:	and we're in the mountains in Virginia.
B:	Oh.
A:	And most of the seafood's frozen.
B:	Uh, yeah
B:	that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.
B:	No fresh, or almost no fresh seafood
A:	Right.
B:	and in Texas we got it from the Gulf.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's true.
A:	Lots of shrimp.
B:	And, yeah,
B:	here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation.
B:	And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week.
A:	I know it
B:	And it was,
B:	I was like a man starving at every meal.
A:	I know the feeling.
A:	We do the same thing.
A:	My son-in-law is a Texan,
A:	and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there
B:	It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?
B:	Lobster?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	It's like two ninety-eight a pound for a pound lobster.
B:	It's like shrimp on the Gulf.
B:	Two ninety-eight a pound.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's as cheap as steaks some places I mean in a grocery store.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	cheaper,
A:	right.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
A:	A lot of the restaurants you can get two two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety-nine.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	I've got to go to Maine then rattling in
B:	You may have sold a trip for some time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a good place to go.
B:	Uh, it sounds wonderful.
B:	Uh, so,
A:	Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.
B:	That sound good.
B:	Uh, down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little uh, seafood shacks, we've called them.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen. You know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We went to
B:	shrimp straight out of the bay.
A:	We were in Galveston last year right well, the first of this year, actually.
B:	Hm.
A:	And, ate in a restaurant,
A:	and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.
B:	Was it true?
A:	No.
A:	It wasn't.
A:	On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place.
A:	And they had,
A:	it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way,
A:	and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet.
B:	Hm.
B:	Huh.
A:	That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.
A:	They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	the cajuns.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	right.
A:	It was wonderful.
B:	They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, have you eaten crawfish yet?
A:	Uh, I tried it,
A:	but I didn't care for it.
A:	Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.
B:	Oh, as with anything, it's preparation.
A:	That's probably true.
A:	It,
A:	We just,
A:	he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them.
B:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It,
B:	there's all kinds,
A:	Probably needed some cold beer with it
A:	and
B:	So you do eat out a lot.
A:	Quite a bit.
B:	One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.
A:	Oh.
B:	You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.
A:	Right.
A:	We used to do that, once in a while,
A:	but we don't anymore.
B:	Uh, we still find it fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's fun,
A:	but it's just so much food
A:	Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable
B:	Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.
A:	Do you,
A:	well that makes a difference.
B:	And so,
A:	Where do you go to brunches?
A:	Like at hotels, or restaurants there?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	We eat at Shoney's.
B:	Yeah,
B:	in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well,
B:	but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation. And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that sounds nice.
B:	It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.
A:	Right,
A:	I imagine it is.
B:	I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch.
B:	You know, and it's not that far.
B:	It's thirty miles.
A:	out of, which direction?
B:	Colorado Springs.
A:	Out of, which direction from there?
B:	West
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	west out of Colorado Springs.
A:	What are your favorite programs?
B:	Uh, it's kind of hard to put my finger on a, on a favorite T V program,
B:	however, uh, one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS.
B:	And, uh, And, uh, it's going to be going off the air, uh, let's see, a week from a week from tonight.
A:	Oh, how funny.
B:	It's going to be its last show.
B:	So I've, I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years.
B:	I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it.
B:	And, uh, I was, uh, greatly disappointed, uh, when I did move down to Plano to, uh, find out that the, uh, the, uh, great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house.
A:	I've seen the sign that goes to there.
A:	I've,
A:	well I think I've seen it in the distance.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I have not even seen it.
A:	And I have not seen the program.
B:	Oh well, That's a shame.
A:	So
A:	And, and, uh, I know when we went to London, it was really funny.
A:	Uh, people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the, the Texas, uh, the, the cowboys and by that program.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	And that's, that's the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas.
A:	So,
A:	I,
A:	and I,
A:	they asked me, uh,
A:	several times, several times they ask me, why are there two bridges?
A:	And I didn't know what they were talking about.
A:	It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is that,
A:	that is right, isn't it?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because they ask me, why are there two bridges going into Dallas?
A:	Darned if I know
A:	I was blank looking, you know.
A:	I felt really dumb.
B:	Well, it's, it's, uh,
B:	when you look at the, uh, you know, route seventy-five, coming down there. I mean, it's actually a bridge,
B:	but it's a bridge over top of roadway.
B:	There's no water there. I mean, uh,
A:	Well, there's water in the Trinity.
A:	I thought it was to, going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well there's, there, uh,
B:	well they,
B:	I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas.
A:	Oh, do they?
B:	One from the east and one from the west.
A:	Uh.
B:	And that's why.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	But it kind of confuses people.
B:	But, uh, uh, I enjoy, uh, uh, a lot of different comedies.
B:	Um, I think it's mainly for an escape, um, you know, you, uh, my job is not the most thrilling in the world
B:	and, uh, I enjoy laughing and, uh, some of the shows that, uh, are on the air, some are just purely, you know, brain drainers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then there's other ones that, uh, deal with, uh, in a funny manner, uh, socially relevant things.
B:	And, uh, one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN. Uh,
A:	I think that is just a hoot.
A:	That's one of those few that I do watch when the television is on.
A:	My husband likes to watch T V.
A:	It's on.
A:	I usually read and watch T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that's one of the few that I just actually watch.
A:	Because it's funny.
B:	Yes.
A:	I really enjoy that one.
B:	Yes.
B:	It, uh, it has been very entertaining
B:	and, and also, uh, the, the issues they deal with, uh, really tends to open, open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems.
B:	And, uh, I've, I've really enjoyed that one since it came on.
B:	Um, I don't like the politics surrounding the program though,
B:	but, I mean, other than that, you know, there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses.
B:	But, uh,
B:	and then, uh, I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff, uh, public, uh, T V.
B:	Uh, I like things like NOVA and, uh, some of the, the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff.
B:	I just enjoy watching that stuff.
A:	Now, we watch a lot of those.
A:	Uh, and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, uh, recently about the Gettysburg Address.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they wrapped a fictional story around it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I thought that was well done.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and it, it caught my attention.
A:	I wound up watching the whole thing.
A:	Uh, I guess the awards ceremonies, and there seems to be dozens of them per year.
A:	Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not
A:	But they could take that whole collection
A:	and it would disappear
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, particularly take issue with those.
A:	I, I really dislike those.
B:	Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, um, if ever watch one.
B:	Uh, there's just not that much I'm, I'm interested in.
B:	Um, for a while, I, I, I watched some football,
B:	but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and, and watch a baseball game.
A:	You know, my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys.
A:	And now, we're out running around,
A:	and if they're, if they're playing, he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is,
A:	and he'll listen.
A:	But, even I've said, hey look, you're fascinated with this, you sit and listen to the Cowboys.
A:	Let me run in here,
A:	and I'll do some things
A:	and I'll come back
A:	and you don't have to miss, he'll say, na, na, na.
A:	And he doesn't, he doesn't watch it.
A:	He like I say,
A:	if it's convenient he'll listen to it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to.
B:	Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and they were doing real well.
B:	I, uh, I
B:	personally, I, I came from the Washington area.
B:	And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan.
A:	Uh.
A:	Oh, those people.
A:	Yeah
B:	And, uh, when I came down to Dallas, it was, uh, you know, I found myself rooting for the home team.
B:	I, uh,
B:	in fact I have a, uh, a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys.
A:	Oh, how neat.
A:	Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	And, I, I, I make the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything
A:	and,  uh, that was, that was a lot of fun.
A:	But, I don't know, I haven't been as,
A:	I'll tell you what I love to watch. And this is not, this is rarely on television.
A:	But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football.
B:	Huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like it so much better than straight football.
B:	No,
B:	I haven't seen that.
A:	It, it doesn't,
A:	it has a lot of different rules.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The field is half the size
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there's no,
A:	they can't call time and things like that.
A:	It moves a lot faster.
B:	uh. Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime.
B:	It's,
A:	Uh, again I think it may be on cable more than anything else.
B:	Yeah,
A:	We  don't have cable.
B:	that's probably true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we don't either.
B:	I, uh, I couldn't rationalize paying, you know,
B:	it's like if I pay for a movie channel, then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them.
B:	And if I, you know, if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic, well I can get that for free.
B:	And well, I really don't need C N N, I see enough bad news all the time.
B:	I don't need to see more of it.
B:	So I, I've kind of, uh, rationalized that it's, it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see.
A:	Well,
B:	And of course when we were living in Texas, it was real convenient with Tom Thumb.
A:	Oh.
B:	You know, having movies, uh, back then it was ninety-nine cents.
B:	I mean, go,
A:	They're everywhere, they're on every corner.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Everything you've ever wanted to see.
B:	Um. You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax.
A:	Well, and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or it becomes snack time for various reasons.
A:	You can put, you know,
A:	the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	I do too.
A:	Because I understand that, that your, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And I, uh, I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it.
B:	She, she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty,
B:	and, uh, you know, she just doesn't like them.
B:	And, um, she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie.
B:	And I've told her, you know, everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick.
A:	That's what I hear too.
B:	And, uh, so I'm, I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon.
A:	Well, my husband smokes.
A:	He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes.
B:	Um.
A:	And you can't smoke in movie theaters.
A:	And that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies.
A:	But I haven't really cared up until this point.
A:	But I,
A:	we are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES.
A:	It's,
A:	that's it.
A:	We will do it.
B:	Um.
A:	So,
B:	That's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	finally.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But as, as far as, uh, regular T V shows, I mean, I've got some, some shows that, that, that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched
B:	And then there's, there's others that, uh, uh, I wish I had time to see.
B:	It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS.
B:	It's very funny.
B:	Some of the things in it are mindless,
B:	but I, I just don't have time to watch it.
B:	Um, I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night.
B:	Because, um, I work so hard over the weekend, doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday.
B:	Monday night I'm just worn out.
B:	So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and, and look over things.
B:	And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at, you know, do, go through my mail and, and watch T V at the same time.
A:	Well, I tend,
A:	my job tends to be very demanding.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to,
A:	I'm actually at work.
B:	Oh,
A:	I'm in facilities and happen to have, uh, weekend duty here.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	What building do you work in?
A:	I'm in the South Building.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	We, we pull mostly evenings.
A:	We are having,
A:	there's three of us, uh, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts. Just to have somebody here, uh, from management to, uh, see if they need anything.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	Oh, the,
A:	how many calls have you made?
B:	I've only made a few.
A:	Okay.
B:	Um,
A:	I'm, uh, getting close to twenty.
A:	This is the,
A:	yeah, hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one,
A:	but I don't really have a lot in this one.
A:	Usually I can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick .
A:	Go ahead, you first
B:	Okay,
B:	our topic for today is invasion of privacy.
B:	So, I got a good one.
A:	Okay,
A:	good.
B:	When the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock,  at night. It rings and you get this recording
A:	Okay, yeah.
B:	and then it won't go away
B:	and any, any of the type of solicitation that, where they call all the time, you know.
B:	There are evenings especially Friday nights, Thursday and Friday nights.
B:	Well, we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night.
B:	More people call, that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall, you know, your sitting down to eat and the phone rings
B:	and,  it's like, I don't want anything, thank you very much
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I,
A:	the worst one, I guess, is like you, when it's a recording. I I don't mind so much someone calls
A:	and it's a, and it's a salesperson, at least you can chat or whatever and say, okay, now, we want to go
A:	and then when, when they actually start off with a, a computer,  and expect you to talk to a computer, uh, that's where I draw the I just hang up immediately, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh, shut my other radio off here
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's real irritating to me.
A:	Uh, I guess they get their
A:	I'm, I'm amazed the question about that the,
A:	my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine
A:	and I have one too,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,
B:	They can leave their whole spiel on it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they can erase all your others, you know, because if you have,
A:	I think that's the way it is, no, mine, I guess, if it's full, it will not take it, I'm not sure.
A:	But they can certainly, uh, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, uh, and your answering machine is full, you know,  it won't erase.
B:	Huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	I,
A:	But your right. *your you're
A:	That was a good one.
B:	yeah,
B:	that's, that's a high irritant for me.
B:	Drives me crazy.
B:	And it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so it really, really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not.
B:	And they pass around, uh, cards that have everybody's name on it.
B:	Like if you order something through a mail order catalog,  you know, then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in. And a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or they sell their catalog list of people,  to different companies and everything.
A:	Yeah.
A:	but it's, uh, annoyance for me in the office with, uh, speaker phones.
A:	You know, I,
A:	they're great for an office
A:	but this one guy next to me, who's not here just so I could talk about him,  he uses his speaker phone all the time,
A:	and it carries over
A:	and so not only would you hear,
A:	it seems to me that you talk longer from you kind of yell into it.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, and so he yells into it,
A:	and you hear the other person too,
A:	so it's kind of a double annoyance.
A:	He actually, uh, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the T I offices are so open anyway. Uh, that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about ready to say something, uh, if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing, an, an invasion of everyone else's time and, and concentration to just be loud.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and, and annoying, you know.
A:	Uh, that's,  perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I think it is,
A:	and
A:	we both picked phone items there.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Let's see, I'm trying to think.
B:	Oh, have you heard that, that, I'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, uh, be giving out information about your financial status.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I heard something about, not that exactly,
A:	but go ahead.
B:	Well, um, I work in the computer science center
B:	and so we hear a lot about things that are, that computers are capable of doing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it.
B:	And they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera, et cetera.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they finally, uh, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,  because it was such a big deal.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either.
B:	I mean, there was a lot of stuff going on about it.
A:	Well, I, uh, heard something similar to that.
A:	I listen to,
A:	I'm a, uh, uh, talk show person.
A:	And there was,
B:	Okay.
A:	when I, when I do my chores up at the
A:	I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends,  and Neil Sperry and everybody, I mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a a financial application, all that information on there is really not necessarily,
A:	even a, your Social Security number, you know, they,  you should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want to answer.
B:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Whether it's your personal salary or whatever.
A:	Uh, if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down
A:	and I was curious as to you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down.
B:	Huh.
A:	But he says Social Security, you don't need to put that down there. Which I thought was surprising.
A:	So maybe there's something along that same line where, you know, in all these financial, uh, applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there.
A:	It would be nice to know what's, what was,
A:	of course, of course, they could say, well, I can't give you a card,
A:	and you could say, fine,
A:	but, you know, some things will be private, you know,
A:	but he said just put N A
A:	and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money they want your card.
A:	But if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's real interesting.
B:	I know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,  on several things and, you know, your credit ap and all, all they ever need you to do is give them permission to, to pull a credit thing on, on yourself
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	and there it is.
B:	That's all they really care about.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They just want that credit history to see if you're a person.
B:	If you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that.
A:	I haven't,
A:	I don't have any friends down at the, the Austin plant,
A:	but I heard that they were really upset about the drug thing,
A:	and we seem to up here have just breezed through that
A:	and apparently some other companies are having trouble
A:	that, I don't have any trouble with it.
A:	Uh, it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas, you know, the biggest location and, and it just breezed through
A:	and wasn't really, no one was, I guess, was really too concerned about it, uh, yet in Austin, there, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it,  that they were objecting to
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
B:	Right
A:	And, uh.
B:	and I, I think there's an attempt to do that.
B:	You know, I think people,
B:	there's a mild attempt for that,
B:	but I think basically, we basically associate news with bad news or, or catastrophes or problems or crises, or, uh, you know.
A:	Yes,
A:	we do.
B:	I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen.
B:	It's more negative, like you said.
A:	True,
A:	true.
B:	But, I think people try to, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good stuff,
B:	but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't sway the vote.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've heard an interesting comment also that, uh, with budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh, investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues,
A:	but that takes time,
A:	that takes an awful lot of money and commitment,
A:	and, and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things,
A:	so. I don't know,
A:	I guess the economy is, is effecting also the news media
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we have to pay that price,
A:	but, uh, I don't know,
A:	I don't know.
A:	It's interesting,
A:	and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,
B:	Right.
B:	You know, the war last winter was certainly a good example of that  because we saw every single thing, practically.
A:	Exactly.
A:	We saw,
A:	Yes,
A:	you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or, or luxury to, to view that.
A:	So.
B:	I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered.
B:	I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake, and just seeing that happen
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the, and the announcers, you know grabbing,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with
A:	Okay,
A:	Mike, I guess we'll be talking about painting recently.
A:	Any kind of recent painting you've done, uh, yourself?
A:	Have you done any recently?
B:	Well, we, uh, remodeled a bathroom. And, which required, uh, completely repainting the bathroom,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the other project we've done around here is, uh, we've remodeled all our, all our closets which required quite a bit of painting.
A:	Wow,
A:	wow,
A:	that's, that's quite a chore.
A:	Yes,
A:	I imagine it did.
A:	Did you have that done professionally
A:	or did you do that yourself?
B:	No,
B:	we did it ourselves,
B:	did it myself.
A:	Did you enjoy that?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, that's, that's fun.
A:	We just recently, uh, had our boys' room,
A:	our two oldest boys share a room,
A:	and they're, uh, the paint has, uh, kind of faded and deteriorated,
A:	and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth,
A:	and, uh, looks quite good.
A:	We were quite pleased with the result.
B:	Is this a project you did yourself?
A:	Yes,
A:	it's a project, uh, that I did,
A:	yes,
A:	and, and, uh.
B:	What, what brought about the fading of the paint?
A:	Well
B:	Just sun exposure?
A:	I don't think it's sun exposure,
A:	but, uh, boys will be boys,
A:	and there, there were crayon marks on there
A:	and we had to, to scrub the crayon marks off, of course, try and get it clean.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	yeah.
B:	Latex paint?
A:	Pardon me?
B:	Latex?
A:	Yes
A:	it was.
A:	It was latex paint,
A:	and that's, uh, what we put back on there, was a latex paint.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Plus, uh, they had bunk beds,
A:	and the boy, one of the younger boys, when he was younger, about three years old, got a, uh, got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures
B:	On the ceiling?
A:	Yes,
A:	on the ceiling.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, you scrub and you scrub,
A:	but you can't it all off.
B:	No,
B:	that's true.
A:	And so, that's one of the reasons why we painted,
A:	and, uh.
B:	Did you go, what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling?
A:	We used a flat, latex paint
B:	Okay.
A:	and in the bedroom, as I understand, that's, uh, one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and, and glassy colored,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it, uh, turned out real, real well.
B:	Seems like, uh, I've, we've done some remodeling of some, uh, rental houses that we have
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it appears as though that, uh, oh, in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built, uh, they used a lot of, uh, semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints, it seemed like.
B:	We had an occasion, uh, where we had to do some sealing of, uh, the of the, this type of paint before we could paint it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, you had to prime it and and cover over it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	Huh.
B:	You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint?
B:	You use a particular brand or anything?
A:	Well, I like to use this, this Sears, uh, the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee.
B:	Weather beater type stuff?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the reason being is once I painted, I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later
B:	Understand.
A:	but, uh,
A:	and, uh, we're quite satisfied with that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale,
A:	and we do, do that.
A:	In fact, I was just reading an article,
A:	you mentioned painting your bathroom.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I read an article recently that, uh, you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to, to peel or come off because of the moisture, high moisture content in your bath, bathroom.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a lot like, uh, wall paper.
B:	That's true.
A:	And, uh, did you have any problems with that
A:	or,
B:	Well, the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath,
B:	so we didn't have a problem with that.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	Uh, I have had, I've, uh, have never experienced that type of a problem uh, with a latex paint.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, good.
A:	neither have I
B:	So, you shouldn't have a, you shouldn't have a problem with it.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	They're, they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and Sears is one of the better ones.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I've used, uh, many a gallon of them, myself.
A:	Do you, uh, have you ever used an oil base paint?
B:	Uh, used oil base paints for trim you know, like around doors and, and on doors, things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	why do you use that?
A:	I'm, I'm kind of learning at this, new at this,
A:	but. It adheres better, or lasts longer?
B:	Uh, primarily because it, it seems to be a little more, uh, well, let's say
B:	well, not so much that.
B:	It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings as opposed to, uh, a latex type paint.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it just, you know, it, it gives you a, a variance even though it's the same color.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, that's good,
A:	that's good.
B:	So it's worked out pretty well for us.
A:	Uh, have you ever done any painting outside?
B:	Uh, quite a bit,
B:	painted a couple of houses.
B:	Uh, recently this summer we painted a, uh, out building, which is a shed that we have on the,
A:	Okay,
A:	where does she live?
B:	Uh, on Rutherford.
A:	Rutherford.
A:	I don't know that.
B:	It's, uh, corner of New York uh, just west of Mayfield.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's, oh, oh, south and, okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know where you, I know the area.
B:	Uh.
A:	Right,
A:	that's kind of on the other side of town,
A:	so our kids probably never went to school together or anything
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, they're, they're little ones
A:	Oh, well, I've got one in college
B:	Oh.
A:	By now.
B:	Let's see, we're on government,  whether we think it's honest or can be.
A:	Right.
A:	Whether it is possible to have an honest government. I'm beginning to think it's not.
A:	What about you?
B:	I, I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.
A:	I don't either.
A:	I, I think,
A:	uh, even if people have good intentions, I think uh, power corrupts or something to a certain extent, you know.
B:	The ultimate power, ultimately corrupts.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it seems like, uh, maybe more of them come in with good intentions,
A:	but it's just so enticing,
A:	and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know
B:	I don't know if,  there is enough money that you could pay them just,  you know X amount of money to keep them honest.
A:	Oh.
B:	I just, I just don't, uh,
A:	Right.
A:	I mean, you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions,
A:	you know what I mean?
B:	Right.
A:	Little bitty, little bitty positions in your own home town, and they'll cheat somehow or, you know, bend the rules, use their power.
A:	So maybe it's just man's nature
B:	We had, uh, here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, uh, corruption on, on our county commissioners
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there were several counties, uh, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners
B:	and, I mean, it was to the point of not just losing their job, but going to jail.
A:	Oh, my word.
A:	Oh, wow.
A:	What were they doing taking some,
B:	Oh, they were taking kickbacks.
A:	Oh, no
B:	Yeah
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	Just a little here, a little there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right
B:	Major amount here, a major amount there.
A:	Right
A:	Oh.
B:	But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.
A:	Um. We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington,
A:	but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records.
A:	In other words, they'd go out and have a big, lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained,
A:	but that person wasn't even anywhere near there, you know.
A:	Some of them weren't even in the same city.
A:	One of them had, had cancer and died
A:	and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.
B:	Uh, that's, that's small scale.
B:	I don't know, you know,
B:	I really don't know what could be done. Uh,
A:	I don't, I don't either. Uh, to make it totally honest.
A:	Uh, I think there's, there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner, uh.
A:	However, the things that have gone, gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you know, the  the HUD mess or the S and L.
B:	That's right.
A:	We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.
B:	The cover-ups and,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	I think that, uh, Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing,
A:	and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,
A:	but, uh,
B:	I, uh, I don't know.
B:	I just, uh, I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests.
A:	Right.
B:	I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, uh, on the side that, that,  it seems that when they get up there it's, it's what, if I vote your way, what it'll do for me rather,  than this is the way my constituents want it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	That's right,
A:	but they stay there,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	and this would be for the best for the nation overall.
A:	You're right,
A:	it's just a,
A:	I don't know.
A:	I guess that's where they stay in, uh, in,
A:	they try to stay in office.
A:	But they always please the money people too.
A:	They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run,  for office again.
B:	run,
A:	And,
B:	Maybe
B:	and then you think, well, if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's true.
A:	Boy, it is a big problem,
A:	but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now,
A:	don't you?
B:	I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.
A:	I know.
A:	It's really terrible.
A:	I mean, there was a time, I mean where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman.
A:	I thought he was great
A:	Oh, you know, I had,
A:	some of them seemed like kind of, uh, heroic people.
B:	Well I wonder if they really were,  or if we just really didn't,
A:	Okay,
A:	Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and how they, and do they differ from like mine.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, okay, uh,
B:	most of, most of the, uh, commercial television these days, I'm just a little bit sick of.
B:	Uh, in fact, I don't watch hardly any, uh, television at all with, uh, my other activities.
B:	Uh, between my family and my church et cetera, et cetera, well I don't have time, I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news.
A:	Right.
B:	Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen
B:	but, uh, aside from aside from that, I pretty well, uh, turn it off.
A:	Oh, do you,
A:	yeah.
A:	Oh, I'm sort of a, well,
A:	I'm different from that.
A:	I'm sort of a, a movie buff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I go to a couple of movies a week, sometimes,
A:	but honestly I'm, I'm self-employed,
A:	and a lot of times I will, uh, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office.
B:	I don't blame you.
A:	But, uh, I do it,
A:	it's like entertainment,
A:	and I'm pretty much of a, a junk movie watcher by myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But, uh,
A:	and my kids are all sort of movie watchers.
A:	You know, we, we've always been to a lot of, we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life.
A:	So, but I would just as soon, uh, be doing something else,
A:	it's just that my kids are gone now,
A:	and, and my wife's a school teacher
A:	and sometimes, and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock.
A:	So, you know, I'll come in like five thirty or six,
A:	and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and sometimes I set there all evening.
B:	Yeah
B:	I, well, it,
B:	sometimes if, if it's real good,
B:	like there's more, there's been more than one evening that I've, uh, caught, uh, every animal show that evening on, uh, on the Discover channel.
A:	You bet,
A:	you bet.
B:	And, uh, because they're, uh, they're, they're, you know, they're documentaries and they're.
A:	Well, that's an interesting channel.
B:	Oh, you bet,
B:	in fact I'm glad that it's part of our, uh, basic cable package.
A:	That's great.
B:	But, uh,
A:	You know, I've, I've just never spent any time watching it
A:	and, you know I like my sports and everything
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I,
B:	Oh, oh, me too.
B:	Hello
A:	Watch my Dallas Cowboys.
A:	I watched them to halftime before I left
A:	and I left at halftime
B:	Well, they, they, they whooped up on them.
A:	and started driving.
A:	They sure did.
A:	They just did an excellent job.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and they're in the playoffs,
B:	and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the Eagles
B:	I did.
A:	yeah
A:	luck into it now, I think.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.
A:	Well.
B:	Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson,
B:	but, uh, he's, uh, he's brought the pokes, uh, from a, a one and something team to, uh, playoffs, in what, three years now.
A:	You bet,
A:	as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well, it's, uh, you know, it was the time for the passing of the guard, I mean.
A:	It was.
B:	And I think Tom knew it.
A:	I think so too.
B:	So, uh,
A:	He wanted to go out a winner though.
A:	I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because
A:	Oh, no,
A:	it's, you know he earned his stripes.
B:	yeah,
B:	but, see, nobody remembers him as a loser because he's too, he's too far, he's far too much of a gentleman and a, and a practicing Christian to, uh to ever be thought of as anything but a you know, but a winner.
A:	I know.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's a, he's a winner in anyone's book
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because that's the key there.
B:	Oh, he is,
B:	he is
B:	because he has to like himself before he can like other people. Uh,
A:	You bet.
A:	Little things that disturb me,
A:	and I know he's being a little hardnosed about it
A:	but, uh, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to be there because he's earned it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He deserves it,
A:	and he was the Dallas Cowboys,
A:	and he won't do that yet.
B:	Yes.
A:	So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because he needs to be remembered.
B:	Oh, he will.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, nobody's going to forget Tom Landry.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	no.
B:	Shoot, come now
A:	Absolutely not
A:	That's true,
A:	but he needs to be honored,
B:	I mean, I'd not a
A:	let's put it that way.
B:	you betcha.
B:	I'm not a native Texan by birth
B:	but, uh, I guess if I, uh, length of, length of time I'm in the state now, is what, after you're here twenty years you're considered native.
A:	You bet.
A:	I've been here since seventy-four,
A:	and I feel like a native.
B:	Well, let's see,
B:	I came down March of sixty-nine, went to work for T and I.
A:	Oh, did you.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, I haven't looked back yet either,
B:	so
A:	We came, we came down from New York state in seventy-four, and uh, never had any regrets at all.
B:	Right.
B:	Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had
A:	You bet.
A:	It's been.
B:	and then look at the weather we have down here.
B:	Huh
A:	It's a great place to raise our kids,
A:	and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she's getting married the month before in November,
A:	so
B:	Oh, goodness.
A:	I will have finished, be finished with that.
B:	Well, we're well, we're finished with all but the last one, and trying to get him through his technical school
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, we're, uh, he's over halfway,
B:	so.
A:	Well, good.
B:	You know, we're not staying on the topic of television shows,
B:	but I'm really not too concerned,
B:	are you?
A:	No,
A:	not at all.
B:	No,
B:	me neither.
B:	I'm enjoying the chat. Uh.
A:	Well, I enjoy my T V programs.
A:	I like those,
A:	I like those detective programs.
A:	I like everything.
A:	I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a great show.
A:	Well.
B:	Do you have, uh, some strong feelings one way or the other about, about the care of the elderly?
A:	Well, yes,
A:	I do.
A:	Uh, this is a, a question that hit pretty close to home.
A:	I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago.
A:	He was, his health was failing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, he was adamant about two things.
A:	One was that I take care of my mother,
A:	and two, that he not be put into a home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we talked, uh, about some length,
A:	and I respected his wishes.
A:	He, uh, stayed at home as long as he could,
A:	and then, uh, he died in a hospital.
A:	But, um, I think that, my position is that, uh, you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the, of the, uh, of their clients
B:	Yes.
A:	and, um, because I've heard about the many abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, my graduate work is in speech pathology,
B:	and, uh, so, so, uh, I've thought about this more than once, uh, you know, dealing with
B:	uh, you know, I'm concerned, we're going to have a geriatric, uh, population, in in twenty years it's going to be, you know, phenomenal.
A:	Yeah,
A:	almost thirty, all over thirty percent, isn't it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, and, um, but I have been amazed
B:	and, and in talking with, uh, some of my fellow students, it looks as though, um, nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more
B:	and, uh, in twenty years. Uh, where a lot of students are hoping, uh, to work as an in the home type, uh, uh, approach, where, where the, uh, where there's, you know, the speech therapist, or whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to, uh, work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the, the loved one to stay, you know, at home with the family members.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's, it's difficult for many families, especially in the case of, uh, of Alzheimer's and, and, uh, some of the more degenerative diseases to, uh, say, uh, uh, leave them, to have them at home, because then the family becomes completely, uh
A:	They're captive.
B:	exactly.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and did, did you experience that with your, with your father or not?
A:	Uh, we had a, at one stage we had care somewhat like, like what you're talking about.
A:	We had the Visiting Nurses program
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they sent somebody in,
A:	and it, it was a, a nominal charge that this, uh, it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They would try to get him to exercise.
A:	They would try to, uh, you know,
A:	they would check him over to, to, you know, the basic checks.
A:	Try to get him to talk and be motivated
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, that's what we went through.
A:	Uh, up to a point things seemed to be working,
A:	and then, uh, I think, he, he became discouraged
B:	Right.
A:	and they did not know how to take care of that,
A:	and then, um, at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, but, yes,
A:	I agree there's a lot of options.
A:	There could be a lot of options.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think it's time that, uh, we decide to do something about it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	Definitely.
B:	You know, one of the other subjects on the switchboard, and this is one that I've been thinking applies here, uh, where, where, uh, young, young kids, uh, graduating from high school, whether they should do a community service type work.
B:	This would be an excellent example of some where, uh, some place where, um, the community could be more involved, you know, more than just leaving it only to professionals.
B:	There is a lot the community, the community can do to, uh, enhance the, or, or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home.
A:	I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need.
B:	Possibly before.
B:	I don't know now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the church or synagogue, whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but in today's large metropolitan areas, or even in most, even, even the rural areas now, people are not quite as close as they once were.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Uh, the mobility factor, the factor that, uh, oh, we're living longer and people are less trusting, all these things tend to destroy this type of system.
A:	But I agree with you,
A:	there might be some possibilities there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.
B:	I agree.
B:	That's a, that's a good point.
A:	I think they would have to have some training.
A:	Uh, let's see.
A:	Personal computers.
B:	Yes.
A:	So, do you use them?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	um, we own one.
A:	Terrific.
A:	What kind?
B:	Uh, its an Emerson eighty eighty-six, um, two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet.
B:	But, uh, you know, it's, it comes in mighty handy.
A:	Mostly for word processing type things?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	a big chunk of it's word processing.
B:	We're also taking programming classes,
B:	and, uh, so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it.
B:	But, uh, uh, the, uh,
B:	right now we got a project going where we're trying to put, uh, all my wife's stray recipes on the disk.
A:	Nice.
A:	Did you buy a program to handle menus?
B:	Uh, it came with a menus program,
B:	but, uh, that doesn't,
B:	it, it
B:	both, excuse me,
B:	mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured.
A:	Eighty eighty-eight is what you said?
B:	Eighty eighty-six.
A:	Eighty,
A:	oh gosh, it's worth your time to just upgrade,
A:	they're so darned cheap now.
B:	Which,
A:	Computers.
B:	Uh, impoverished college student.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	This one went on a credit card,
B:	and we got a way out, while to pay it off yet.
A:	Uh, I've, I've got one at home too.
A:	It's a three eighty-six, thirty-three megahertz, forty, four meg ram and hundred and thirty meg drive
A:	and super V G A
A:	and, yeah, it's fun.
A:	I do programming, too.
A:	My job is, uh, E D P auditor,
A:	and so I'm into computers all the time.
B:	E D P.
A:	Electronic Data Processing.
B:	Okay,
B:	that sounds like fun job.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I really enjoy it,
A:	and it treats me well.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, what are you studying in college  computers?
B:	Uh.  Computer engineering.
A:	How nice.
B:	Well, computer engineering technology, uh, which, uh, all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering.
B:	But, I've got a ways to go yet.
B:	So far most of what I've done is getting, gotten core classes out of the way,
B:	taken some electronics classes, and one class in, um, with computer logic.
A:	How they work is fascinating to me.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	I enjoy it myself
B:	The, uh, lab for that, uh, computer logic class was a lot of fun.
A:	Was it.
A:	Did,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we got to hook up a few, uh, counters and, uh, encoders.
A:	Hardware stuff, huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you think of that fuzzy logic?
B:	I've not had a chance to work with it, although, um, my, uh, data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know,
B:	but, uh, it sounds like a very impressive piece of, piece of work.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're pretty amazing.
A:	Uh, I've written a couple of programs for, commercially, uh
B:	Yes.
A:	and it's a fun field.
B:	In the fuzzy logic direction?
A:	What,
A:	no,
A:	in, uh,
A:	no,
A:	just regular, uh,
A:	but you have to take into account, you know, with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Entering bad information of one sort or another
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	pushing keys certain times and, Uh, messing up your files and things like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you're going to be an engineer, computer engineer type.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	well, what the computer, what the C E T program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from,
B:	you get programming, a fair amount of programming,
B:	you get hardware,
B:	you get, uh, more or less, uh, you get basic electronics courses that, uh, deal with, you know, not only the digital circuitry but, uh, you know, power supplies and, and, uh, just the whole gambit, but mostly towards, uh, computer electronics.
B:	So, the idea is that, um, you can go in a variety of direction from C E T major,
B:	but I I have more with the hardware than I do with the software,
B:	so, yeah
B:	I pretty much plan on, I mean, so far I'm planning to go in the engineering direction.
A:	I don't,
A:	That's good, uh,
A:	Set.
B:	Okay.
A:	You, you got the topic, right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, well, where in Dallas are you?
B:	I'm in Richardson.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	So you do do recycling there?
B:	Yeah,
B:	Richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly, if it's not raining.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,
B:	but they don't pick up the other items.
B:	They don't pick up cans or the plastic.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Are they going to later,
A:	do you know?
B:	I'm not sure.
B:	They only started to do the newspaper uh, late last year.
B:	Just kind of like a trial basis. And see how it goes, so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	What about you?
A:	Well, I'm, I'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I know they do have, you know, a pilot program going on
A:	but it's not here.
B:	Um.
A:	So they're not picking up anything
B:	Oh.
A:	So, I mean, we, we collect everything
A:	We've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything.
B:	Where do you take them?
A:	Well, there's, there's a couple places.
A:	Unfortunately, we can't find a place that will take everything.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags like most of the grocery stores.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything.
A:	I can't remember what it is they don't take.
B:	Um.
A:	And the library will take glass.
A:	So we end up, you know,
A:	on the weekend we pack it all in the car
A:	and, and as we go places we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off you know.
B:	Um.
A:	Drop things off one at a time,
A:	but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, I mean,
A:	I would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where you could do everything.
A:	You know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now.
B:	One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter.
A:	Um.
B:	I think it was closer to downtown.
A:	Where is that?
B:	Uh, she's not here anymore
A:	Oh.
B:	but, uh, yeah,
A:	I'm pretty far north.
A:	I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison actually.
B:	Oh.
A:	So I'm, I'm really
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm in Dallas, but only technically
B:	Well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen those.
B:	You don't get too much money back.
B:	I figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But normally I collect, oh, like three trash bags full
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I take them over to that can bank
B:	and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans in the can bank.
B:	Don't get too much money for them
B:	but,
A:	Well, you get something
A:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	We used to do that,
A:	but, again, that's another stop
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing,
A:	but, uh, I think that, you know, I heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is
A:	and so hopefully they'll do it soon.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, where I grew up we only had one a week
A:	and that was certainly sufficient.
A:	So if they just do,
A:	one of them will be trash
A:	and the alternate time would be recyclables,
A:	that would be great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers, you know.
B:	I seem to put them out there on Wednesday
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and like sometimes they come by,
B:	sometimes they don't.
A:	Oh.
B:	I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.
A:	Um.
B:	But I could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic and and tin and paper, whatever they were going to, uh, separate into and, and have them pick it up on, on one of the two days per week.
A:	Right.
B:	That would be easy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that, that sort of thing
A:	or do they take the whole thing?
B:	You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you can't take newspapers.
B:	Now at work, uh, you know, we have changed our recycling.
B:	At first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle.
B:	And not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first they said,
A:	Let me guess
A:	you work at T I,
A:	right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	at first they said, They said, no telephone books.
A:	So do I.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, well, that's stupid
B:	and then they said no newspapers.
A:	Um.
B:	Well, in the, my department everybody gets the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
A:	Yeah.
B:	There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,
B:	say,
A:	Well, and they take cans, now, too. Which is great.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I still put my cans in with the cans.
B:	I mean, I don't want it with paper.
B:	Somehow that just seems weird to me
A:	Well, our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project.
A:	And, In fact we got, this past year, we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year.
B:	Oh.
B:	Ooh.
A:	And it worked out really well.
B:	Well, we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that's what that was called.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She collected, she used to collect from the whole department,
B:	but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I wish I could remember the whole name of that place,
B:	but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, yeah,
B:	she, she used to collect them from everybody in the department.
A:	Yeah.
B:	She'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because we would get it,
A:	Okay,
A:	you got any hobbies that you want to talk about?
B:	Well, I, uh, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to,
B:	but, I guess I'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies.
A:	What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time?
B:	Well, I sit and design cards
A:	Oh, really?
B:	and, uh, oh, I, I'm really into graphics,
B:	so, it, it just, I sit and learn new programs
B:	and I play
B:	and I do this,
B:	and I do that
B:	and, I'm, I'm starting a side business in desk top publishing
A:	Did you have, uh, your own business
A:	or you do that as, just on the side, or what?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's just getting going.
B:	I, I'm teaching in the daytime
A:	Well.
B:	and, uh, I teach business and computer technology.
A:	What do you teach?
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	Well, I guess
B:	It's, uh, to high school kids, it's, uh, alternative learning
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's, it's really a challenge,
B:	but. What hobbies do you have?
A:	Well, I, uh, play trombone in the Plano Community Band.
B:	Ooh, neat.
A:	And I, uh, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike.
B:	Well, I hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did.
A:	Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot.
B:	Oh, well now, yes
B:	I don't think you can blame the weather on that.
B:	We had.
A:	No,
A:	just a crummy, well, actually
A:	the Lions are pretty good, I'm afraid, they a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.
A:	And, uh, .
B:	On any given day, they say.
B:	Uh, I haven't, I haven't played in a while, but I do, when I get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer I like to play golf.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	I, I play that about six times a year
A:	and every year I hang my bag up if I get that five or six
A:	and I swear, swear that game off for another year,
A:	but I always go back to it
B:	Oh, I, uh, oh, I take spells,
B:	I'm, I'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person
B:	and when I start something, I, I go into it a thousand percent
A:	I understand that.
B:	and then I get, I get burned out on it.
B:	But, uh, I do some counted cross-stitch and some painting on shirts.
A:	Well, you do lots of stuff.
B:	Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done,
B:	but I guess I do
B:	and, I, I like to bake.
B:	It's just me in the house,
B:	so, when I bake it's usually to take out for something.
A:	Gosh,
A:	I come up there I'll have to stop by and have, try some of your baking.
B:	Well.
A:	I call on people in .
A:	My business is, uh, machine tool sales,
A:	and I have some,
A:	I, I cover Texas and Oklahoma.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, I, what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that.
A:	I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry, Oklahoma  and Eda and all that, all that way.
B:	Oh, how neat.
B:	So you do quite a bit of traveling then.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
A:	I,
A:	about thirty-three thousand miles a year.
A:	So.
B:	Ooh, well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies,
B:	does it?
A:	Well, I usually,
A:	see, we, we have our, our band practice is on Monday night,
A:	and during the summer we, uh, we have concerts every Monday night in the park,
A:	and, uh, we, we have, you know, some concerts during the year,
A:	and, you know, various people in the communities want us to play for things,
A:	but those are usually on the weekend,
A:	so that isn't too bad.
B:	How big is your band?
A:	Well, we got, uh, pretty good size band.
A:	Not everybody shows up,
A:	but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred
A:	but we only average about forty to fifty people a, you know, usually.
B:	Ooh.
B:	Well, that's still a pretty good size band.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's not like there are four or five of you there.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	no.
A:	This is a,
A:	it's a concert band,
A:	and, uh, we have a lot of,
A:	I, I don't pretend to be that good,
A:	but there's a lot of people that, uh, you know, are band directors at schools, or have been,
A:	or, uh, you know, there some people that are actually music majors.
A:	They don't necessarily follow that any more, you know,
A:	that isn't necessarily their career,
A:	but, uh, we have some extremely good talent in there,
A:	and, uh, as a rule, it sounds pretty decent,
A:	so
A:	It's fun.
B:	I, I have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever,
B:	and I'm always very envious of people who do.
A:	Well, I don't know if I have any or not.
A:	I, I've always enjoyed it.
A:	I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.
B:	Well, I'm probably one of the few people that the,
A:	Okay, Lee.
A:	Tell me about your ideas on this, uh, the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth.
B:	Well, I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care
B:	and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately, uh, the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has, uh, provided some very good health care and, uh, much, I think inadequate health care. Uh,
B:	and in some cases, the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces
B:	and I think, uh, it's inevitable.
B:	It is just a matter of, uh, time and mistakes
B:	and they're both inevitable.
A:	Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing, uh, a good job?
B:	Well, it's going to make it tough for them
B:	and it's going to be a difficult transition.
B:	I don't know, uh, how it's going to, uh, play out in terms of the particulars,
B:	but I don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long.
B:	Our, uh, physical and mental and spiritual health, uh, it's really, uh, very costly.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, uh, as a society we are paying a staggering price for this.
A:	Well  this is what's bothering me, Lee, another question,
B:	My,
A:	do you think that there should be some control, uh, innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things.
A:	We realize that for the individual person, some things are very important.
A:	Uh, matter of fact, in some respects their life might depend on it.
B:	Right.
A:	But, by the same token some of these charges they make for well, minor endeavors, shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there are  they're abusive of privileges
A:	There should be some control of that.
A:	Yes
A:	and that is what is giving the local, uh, insurance companies hard times.
A:	That is the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals
A:	and you get something done
A:	and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, this I think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten, or twenty or thirty years will address.
B:	Because I know this is, addressed by, uh, in Canada.
B:	I, I have a good friend who is, uh, a physician practicing in Canada.
B:	And they made the transition, uh,
B:	and I think that the, uh,
B:	for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries uh,
A:	Yes.
A:	We have had several of them.
A:	My wife and I both have had that recently.
B:	I've, I've had one myself
B:	and, uh, they're wonderful technology,
B:	but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need.
B:	So, I think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked
B:	and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency, uh, at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills,
B:	but it's begun to change all of that.
B:	The people paying the bills, uh,
B:	employers ultimately, have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I think the evolution will be interesting.
B:	Uh, Hawaii has a system that is apparently working
B:	and, uh, it will be interesting to see how, how, uh, much more attention we pay to that.
B:	I do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain, uh, that people are feeling, uh, under the circumstances.
B:	Uh, I believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care, whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers, uh,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I like that idea.
B:	I tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well.
B:	Uh, I, we would be a lot better off if we, if we, contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste.
A:	See, that, that bothers me about the government see,
A:	uh, my,
B:	Well that's, that's the problem with government, uh, administration of these programs
B:	and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with.
B:	Government is going to have to change in this regard.
A:	Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis?
B:	You know, that is really a tough one for me to answer.
B:	I don't, uh, I would like to see the greatest improvement in management.
B:	My, my, my field is the cognitive sciences
B:	and I recognize that a lot of these things that are done, are done, uh, as a function of the operating systems in place.
B:	And those operating systems have to change
B:	and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems
B:	and so a State or federal application, uh, could work.
B:	Uh, it all depends upon the way you structure the environment.
B:	We may have to deal with,
A:	I'm ready.
A:	Well in Atlanta, Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California.
B:	Oh could, could be.
A:	Uh, this little city is only about eight thousand people.
B:	Huh.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we,
B:	is, is crime a problem there?
B:	like a major problem, minor problem or,
A:	Well in Patterson there's,
A:	it's not a problem here.
A:	But like, uh, I lived in Oakland, uh, until just recently
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, Oakland, California, God, they've had like, uh, sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to like, uh, forty at this time last year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it's really bad there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and it's all related to drugs it seems like.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Is that what it's there too?
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've only been here for like, uh,
B:	probably just over six months I start, I  started school here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I came from a smaller town in, in New York
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the city was fairly big size or not real big
B:	but we had a problem there
B:	but here there's just no comparison that, much more crime.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, every night the news is very depressing because it just, they run down the list of how many people were shot, you know, drive by shootings or whatever
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's, it, it's pretty bad.
B:	They're, they're,
B:	it's,
B:	things have basically improved here over the last few years.
B:	They've, they've actually taken steps to try to make it better
B:	but it still, it still is a problem.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen.
B:	Well that's, that seems to be what they were doing
B:	and it has, and they've started, stepped up more patrols in certain areas
B:	and it has has made some places safer
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, it's very difficult.
B:	I mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to, to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could as it is a, it's definitely a problem
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and you know, the more, more, less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well I, I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands
B:	Right.
A:	and, you know, then maybe those other people would be kind of scared
A:	and they would not do these bad things, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think, I think that, uh, it's, uh, seems to be that, I don't know, some people they they do something, you know,
B:	they shoot somebody or whatever,
B:	they go to jail,
B:	sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five
B:	and they're back on the street
B:	and then they shoot someone else
B:	and just a, a cycle
B:	and it seems, seems as though the, the system doesn't tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I just don't understand our, our laws here.
A:	Because, you know, like in other countries, man, I mean, they're really a lot stricter than we are.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's, definitely true.
B:	It seems, seems as though we try to play humanitarian I think to, a little to much *typo too
B:	and maybe some of the people don't deserve the, the humanitarian treatment that they get.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But I don't know.
B:	It's a difficult situation I think
B:	and some, something has to be done because I definitely think it's, it, it really plays, reeks havoc with your quality of life when, you know, you can see it's going on around you
B:	but then when, once it finally affects you then, then it really starts to bother you.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh. Uh,
B:	But it seems, I mean,
B:	people have moved like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime
B:	and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out
B:	but, you know, it's only a matter of time before, you know, it still catches up with them.
B:	You can't really run away from the problem
A:	Yeah.
B:	and something, you know, something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know when I lived in Oakland, it was just that, uh, like, I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of, of the city by myself.
B:	Oh, sure.
A:	And, uh, and then, then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	But down here, in Patterson, well like I say, it's so small that you can go anywhere.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's good .
A:	But just, uh, like twenty miles away see in Modesto, they have, uh, those gangs and things over there.
B:	Right.
A:	And it, it's bad.
A:	In Sacramento also, they have, uh, drive by shootings it seems like all the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just, I just don't know what, what they can do you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's, it's to bad because it's, uh, I mean, just even the random occurrences where, you know, it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the, some, in certain areas like from the car, from their car to the mall or something
B:	and it's dangerous.
A:	I know.
B:	And it's just, that's just ridiculous
B:	and you know, it's just, that's just not right.
B:	Something you know .
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean like even, even going to the grocery store.
A:	I know we've had this one lady that was attacked, you know.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	I mean, just, you just, you just don't know what to do anymore, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	And some of the times it's happening in the daytime too, you know,
A:	so it's not always happening at dark.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's definitely unfortunate
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, let me see
A:	I've been sitting here awhile.
A:	I almost forgot the topic.
A:	But, uh, it seems like I get most of my news from television.
A:	I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends
A:	and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader
A:	or but I, I and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, uh, radio
A:	so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night. News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well I get a, weekend paper as well
B:	and, uh, in addition to that I get a local weekly.
B:	I, I live in suburb of Milwaukee
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they get, they have community newspapers around here so the local, their extremely local stuff uh, is in the local paper that comes out once a week
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I get the Sunday, uh, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper.
B:	Uh, mostly  that's my difficulty.
A:	Right.
B:	I, uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which  has very good, uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Are you in the car quite a bit
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	I'm not actually. Uh,
B:	but I can run my radio in my office.
B:	I, I  teach at the university
A:	Oh.
B:	and when I'm not teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,
A:	Oh.
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I see. Uh,
B:	How are you, are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, I pretty much am
A:	and I watch the news at least twice a day.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, if I've missed something and, and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children
A:	and so it seems as if I catch the news right as it happens, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There was the explosions and that kind of thing.
A:	My husband will say how did you know about that.
A:	Yes,
A:	it happened at such and such time
A:	And that's so, that, that's different for me.
A:	So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.
B:	Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely noting of the events as they happen?
B:	Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage?
A:	Uh, no
A:	it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, you know.
A:	It's just that, uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it happened
A:	and,
B:	Well, I, myself, uh, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories uh, is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	The local doesn't either
B:	but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And perhaps newspapers do that
B:	but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper
B:	and frankly when I have read a newspaper I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	So. Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too.
B:	Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, you know, how good is it.
B:	But, uh, I like a little more indepth coverage
B:	and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That kind of thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. Uh,
B:	I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world  rather than simply being aware that, you know, there, that an event has occurred
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture.
B:	Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail.
B:	I don't know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know what you're saying.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's
A:	and if I miss them, I try you know, I try and, and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing,
A:	I try and tape them
A:	and so I can sit back and watch them.
A:	And it's pretty interesting.
B:	When,
B:	you have young children, right?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.
A:	Well, yeah.
A:	Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things
B:	Oh, you do?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	If I don't want any interruptions, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That kind of thing.
B:	When is your good watching time?
A:	Uh, it seems like ten o'clock at night
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what,
A:	Unfortunately,
A:	but that, that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.
B:	I have older children and getting dinner on the table.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	I come from the east coast
B:	and I was,
B:	it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when,
A:	Uh, in Texas they do have the, uh, capital punishment
A:	and, uh, I, I I, I'm probably one that has to agree with it too.
A:	Uh, there
A:	some things that go on that I just feel that I, I, just feel, that, that, that is a need.
A:	I don't know.
A:	A lot of people don't feel that way either
A:	but I just feel that
B:	Well I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state
B:	but California we just put somebody to death uh, for, I think it was a double murder.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, uh, to the details of it. Uh,
B:	but it had a lot of controversy out here.
B:	Uh, basically, because in California people like to protest about everything.
B:	Uh, but I agree,
B:	I believe that, that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh, the big disagreement I have is that in California, the appeals process, uh, is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually, you know, put somebody to death for, for a crime.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is a consequence,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, I mean, that's, that's ridiculous.
B:	I mean if you can, you know, the trial is supposed to prove, you know, within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty,
B:	and then they have appeals.
B:	Well, that's fine
B:	but it shouldn't take more, than a few years.
B:	I mean, I should think  two or three years maximum, you should be able to know
A:	Right.
B:	and you should be able to either put the guy to death
B:	or he's innocent.
B:	I mean  it's, if he's guilty for, for, you know, multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I, I just feel that, that capital punishment needs to stay within the system.
A:	Not all states have them
A:	but I, you know, was that, was that the, I'm not sure if that was in,
A:	was that the man that, that claimed he was abused
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	he was like, uh,
B:	the   the  defense, the defense they're were giving, given was that, uh, like his mother had, had been an alcoholic when, when she was  pregnant with him
A:	And that he had
A:	he ,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and so he, he wasn't, you know, mentally competent or anything else. Which is ridiculous,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and the court found him competent, uh,
B:	and he knew what he was doing and everything else.
B:	I mean you know, it was, it was the best defense they could come up with.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And how long had he been appealing
A:	How long was that?
B:	I forget.
B:	I think it was something like twelve years or something.
A:	Gosh.
A:	Boy.
B:	It was, it was something really outrageous.
A:	Yeah
A:	Boy. Well, I mean
A:	and it seems like it, it rarely does happen.
A:	You know, it's not, it's not used that often you know. At least here in Texas
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I think it's something that needs to stay.
A:	I really do
B:	I think in general, uh, punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be.
B:	I mean, it needs to be, you know,
B:	it's kind of like the, the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet
B:	and you wait three months
B:	and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it. You know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean there, there's no connection between the two.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean you take these, you know, most of the people who are committing violent crimes, most of them, not all by any means,
B:	but, you know, a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, they don't really see past next week much less next year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And to say, you know, well if I kill somebody then a decade from now, I might face the punishment.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's not real.
B:	It doesn't have any real impact on them.
A:	My sister and I were wondering about this recently because a, an old friend of ours in California, this happened about a week ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, her husband just killed her
A:	and we're wondering if that has an effect.
A:	If that, if something, does capital punishment, you know, does it happen with that, within that, uh,
A:	I don't know
B:	Uh, you mean, would he be put to death for that?
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, largely depends on the circumstances
B:	and generally, you know, from what I understand, it's, it's only the most brutal types of things usually.
B:	Where it's multiple, you know.
A:	I think you're right.
B:	If, if they can say things like, you know, well he was just, you know, temporarily insane because of, some domestic squabble then you know, they'll, they'll give him, you know, twenty years with, with parole in, in twelve or something like that
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people
A:	All righty.
A:	Uh, I guess our topic today is air pollution.
A:	And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, does your work entitle, uh, anything of environmental along these lines?
B:	Me, I'm in the legal department
B:	and, um, we do have, uh, a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.
B:	I do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that T I has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground, you know, we're coming up with a, uh, a new solution.
B:	We have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump
B:	and we just transport to these places.
B:	But after awhile it always seems that the, um, oh, the site starts to leak
B:	and then you have to clean it up and such.
B:	But the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman,
B:	and we're going have that, you know, incineration place up there and, dump everything there.
A:	Right.
B:	And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, in, you know, a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.
B:	And that we won't be polluting the air.
B:	I'm sure we have to have, uh, permits, you know, for that place. And that there's, you know, limits as to what we can, uh, let, you know, go into the air.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, uh, uh, uh, well,
A:	I work in , I work in environmentals, uh, projects right now.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And so the Sherman deal is, um, uh, lost a lot of hair over that project.
B:	Oh
A:	Uh, what we run into, um, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, uh, jurisdictions under which we have to, uh, uh, reply to.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear, so we have our manager of environmental, who assist the T A C B, which is located in Austin, in writing
A:	and, hey,
A:	look what we've done here at T I.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we are presently, uh, in receipt of a site permit, which will allow us to, um, uh,
A:	this is our side allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's in, in, in tons per year. Um,
B:	Okay.
A:	and so, you know, what we do to make contributions so that, basically, we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems, uh, that, uh, scrub out the, N O X and, uh, V O C's and, and ammonia compounds, uh, like all the acids, to a certain level.
A:	We, are very, um, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack emissions.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts.
A:	And so what we go through is, uh, if you see it smoking there's a problem.
A:	And having worked with some of the legal folks very closely, uh, it becomes a real issue, especially, when it's smoking
A:	and you have to get it fixed el pronto.
B:	Um.
A:	As you know, they, they're allowed to come on site, the federaldes, anytime they want, drive through, and see, and inspect.
B:	Um.
A:	So it's a full time, uh, everybody has their home phone number type of job. Um,
B:	Now is that place built
B:	or you're still on the makings of it?
A:	The Sherman facility, we are still in the, closer too, but still have a little bit of, um, finalization to do.
A:	Right.
A:	It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, um, open arms, as well as the public.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We had open forum
A:	and, and, uh, uh, Tom Jones, our environmental, corporate environmental guys handle the project.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, its real, uh, going real well.
A:	I think it's matter, just a matter of fund, funds right now as I understand it. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's, uh, it's something else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	they're, they're, they're in the same issue.
A:	We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there.
A:	Uh, because the, the system is setup where it won't have any emissions.
A:	You're correct.
A:	It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was, it was human nature.
B:	Right.
A:	But it won't have can any, uh, any bad stuff.
A:	So, uh, I think T I, we spend, of all the major semiconductor firms, we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost, foremost, uh, uh, first thing we always look at.
A:	And we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of.
A:	We eat and sleep the stuff, everything we do over here.
A:	and, uh, it's an interesting job.
A:	But um,
B:	Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, uh, quite a list of cites that have gone bad
B:	and you have to clean up.
B:	And, you know the law now is the super fund
B:	and anybody who's contributed toxic waste, no matter if you were somebody that eventually, you know, uh, damaged the ground or not.
B:	Uh, everybody has to contribute
B:	and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten, uh, gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and, you know, mega bucks to, uh, you know take everything out and redo it and, you know, fill in some other area
B:	and, um, certainly, it would to have a better solution, like the Sherman facility than, um, just letting it go in the ground.
B:	Because eventually, you know, it, it seems that no matter what they do, if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined, uh, dump area.
B:	It still only in time starts to leak out.
A:	Possibly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There, there was one site that they cleaned up
B:	and then the new place leaked again. .
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm familiar with that one.
A:	We have, we have stuff that's very interesting, uh,
A:	we have hoods,
A:	we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, um, they have, um, that we sample
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it may have over, uh, a certain emission levels,
A:	this is on the solid side ,
A:	and so we take it
A:	and, uh, we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid.
A:	And we mix it with concrete and actually, um, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it in the ground. But not so, not in a hazardous waste location because it's, basically, a concrete slab.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	It was totally legal.
A:	But the cost of doing this is astronomical, they actually show you what duckwork and things.
B:	Um,
A:	And so we were, uh, very, very, uh, cognizance of, and aware of all these types of, uh, expenditures because it could get very expensive.
A:	But I think we, uh, you know, we do all kinds of things to make the, the world a better place to live, you know,
A:	I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that.
A:	I really would.
A:	Um, I've enjoyed speaking with you,
B:	Yeah.
A:	This has been an interesting topic.
A:	Uh, I was one of the,
A:	I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate, or in the north building
B:	Oh, you were?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, uh, I hope you like your office.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
B:	It's a heck of a lot different.
B:	And we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk.
B:	We were about the only, place in, you know, T I that had the gray metal desk.
A:	Yeah.
B:	People used to come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Glad to see y'all taken care of.
A:	Well, the, uh, I think what changed everything and, uh, is, uh, y'all were, y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI, here in the last ten years,
B:	We, finally got a little respect.
B:	Nobody thought of us as a profit center before.
A:	Exactly.
A:	And that's, um, when, when you start, when you start paying your way, uh, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	I was just,
B:	Not just overhead.
A:	Exactly.
A:	I've enjoyed speaking with you.
B:	You too.
A:	See you later.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
B:	Okay,
B:	in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	make sure it's nice and brown on both sides
B:	and then you take it out of the fat
B:	and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan
B:	and you kind of clean it out
B:	and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.
B:	Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.
B:	And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.
B:	Stir it real, real well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.
B:	And you let it come to a boil again
B:	and then you let it simmer
B:	and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.
A:	Oh.
B:	And that's going to, it's going to be really good
A:	That's very spicy, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's,
A:	I mean these bell peppers and curry.
B:	Right,
B:	and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.
A:	Oh, that sounds really good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Huh.
A:	I guess it was,
A:	is this dinner time for you?
B:	Uh, well it will be in a little while,
B:	I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.
A:	All done in advance,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook
A:	but I was single until I was thirty
A:	so I did cook a little, you know.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, and I cook a little bit now.
A:	What I like to do mostly is stir fries
A:	and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight
A:	and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.
B:	What kind of wok do you have,
B:	is it, is it a real Chinese wok.
A:	It's, it's called a stir fry pan
A:	and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric
A:	so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I see.
A:	And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil.
A:	But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.
A:	And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.
A:	That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor
A:	and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've used,
A:	you turn them over.
A:	A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,
A:	we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,
A:	so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.
B:	Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,
A:	It's, it's a pretty big
A:	and we put that over rice.
B:	I just don't like squash.
A:	Oh, you don't
B:	I never did.
B:	My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash
B:	and she'd have squash and corn bread
A:	Oh.
B:	And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'd just be,
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.
A:	My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.
A:	I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh
A:	and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Red meat and a potato.
B:	Oh, that sounds good.
B:	We, we were from North Carolina
B:	and we had a garden
B:	and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash
B:	and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,
A:	Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.
B:	Right.
A:	See, never, no vegetables in my family.
B:	Wow.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was really funny.
B:	You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens
A:	Well that was a real farm.
B:	You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?
A:	No,
A:	but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,
A:	I've heard stories.
B:	And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.
A:	Uh.
B:	And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub
B:	and finally it dies down,
B:	you get just a little patter
B:	and then it,
A:	Oh, this is
A:	you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.
B:	Getting ready to eat chicken too.
A:	That's right,
A:	you should be careful
A:	That's pretty funny.
A:	But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens
A:	but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,
A:	we, we bought everything in a grocery store.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There was no,
A:	but it was funny, you know,
A:	it so,
A:	but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.
B:	Well that's good.
B:	A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.
A:	I think so too,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but we just went shopping
A:	and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts
A:	and uh, we came back with sweets.
B:	Ugh.
A:	We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future, but, uh, the cut back.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian
A:	and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office
A:	and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.
B:	Ugh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was a sweet
A:	and I was like ugh.
A:	This is a sweet.
A:	Oh it is, it's a candy,
A:	I'm like ugh, you know,
A:	Indian candy is not very good.
B:	Uh, right.
A:	But everything was, and everything,
A:	you didn't notice it at first,
A:	but everything was sort of hot.
A:	Everything had a little bit of curry in it.
B:	The spice,
B:	yeah.
A:	It was funny, even the sweets did.
B:	Wow.
A:	When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it
A:	but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it.
A:	You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Good,
A:	they didn't have,
A:	I didn't like her desserts very well,
A:	they were very, yogurt and carrots and pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it wasn't very good.
B:	Well I might have liked some of that
B:	I, I like hot stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really do.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well have we done our ten minutes.
B:	Oh is it ten minutes.
A:	Something like that,
A:	I think we're,
B:	I don't know,
B:	do we get a signal.
A:	No,
A:	normally they just come in
A:	and they say you've overextended your, your conversation.
B:	Oh, well this is my first one.
A:	Oh, okay
A:	well that's,
A:	you'll see it will normally, it will come on
A:	and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to fifteen seconds to complete it.
B:	Oh wow.
A:	But, uh, I've been cut off twice.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I just thought,
A:	in fact I'm just also,
A:	I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know,
A:	he has one of those alarms on his car,
B:	Goodness.
A:	one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car
A:	and it's going off.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.
B:	Well, okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	hey thanks so much.
B:	Yeah,
B:	thank you,
B:	it was nice talking with you.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and you said this was your
A:	well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday,
A:	maybe I talked to somebody that, uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.
A:	It was a housewife
A:	and she was home with two kids.
B:	Ugh.
A:	And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something
A:	and they were arguing back and forth
A:	and she just kept talking the whole time,
A:	it was pretty funny.
B:	Yeah,
B:	kind of hard that way.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	Hey thanks a lot,
A:	I'll talk to you later.
B:	All right,
B:	thank you,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	so, uh, do you own a P C?
B:	Um, no,
B:	not personally
B:	but,
A:	But you have one at work.
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	several
A:	Okay,
A:	and, now because, um,
A:	see I'm, I'm doing my, uh, Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, and I, I don't have one,
A:	but I have to use them, like during, especially during my undergrad.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You, you use, um,
A:	like your first couple of years you use personal computers because, uh, you know, the software.
A:	You know, like it's easier for you to go to and run a program, you know, through the disk, because, um, the grader can do it at home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Then, as the, you know, as you go up higher, like in your senior level, you're doing projects which are, are so big,
A:	and you have to have so many people sharing the same data, that you can't use personal computers, so you have to use, you know, a main frame.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know I, uh, I do have a, uh, you know, a computer at home,
B:	but it's one that the company has loaned me.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And, that, that's been my situation, is that, uh, that way I can get in, access our, uh, computers that I have up here and, you know, do work from home.
A:	But does it have, uh, like, a disk drive?
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	because, uh, the ones that we use, you know, are like UNIX base systems.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, so they don't have a disk drive.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, so you can't,
A:	the only way that you can do it is through a modem.
B:	Right.
A:	And, you, you know, you just do it that way.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, that's, uh, that's the only way that you can get to, through to the system,
A:	you can't store it anywhere.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no
B:	I, um, I, I have both, because that, that's what I use all the time is UNIX Systems. Um, versus the DOS.
B:	But then I teach DOS classes, uh, at night.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	part time.
B:	So,
A:	And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C.
B:	Well, that, that's the really neat thing, I teach in the continuing education classes, so I don't, uh, I don't have to have any grades, no grade books, so that's great
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	But, no,
B:	I find that I use the, the personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect, and also for my spread sheets.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, so I think it's extremely helpful and very useful.
A:	Well, uh, for us it's, uh, uh, you know, it's like for doing like, you know, like resumes, and, presentations.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, um. Uh-huh.
A:	We use like for example, a Mackintosh, which is a lot easier for graphics, than the than you know, the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	Due, due to the fact that, well, you know, I, I haven't tested the, the P S two yet.
B:	Um, um. Uh-huh.
A:	but I don't know if the software is as easily, you know, like you can manage it a lot easier than, than the old one.
B:	Right.
A:	The old one you had to go pick a line, use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where, you know, with the mouse you do it, you know, like, a hundred times faster.
B:	Right.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's true.
A:	And, uh, you also get, you know,
A:	when you see it on the Mackintosh with, you know, the one I have,
A:	that doesn't have any color,
A:	you can look at it
A:	and that's the way it's going to print out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, especially if you have a laser printer, it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen.
B:	Oh, Uh-huh.
A:	And, so, with, you know, with the I B M what would happen is, uh, since the software that I had was, it was basically, you know, you only see part of the page.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, so, the whole page you, you never can actually see it,
B:	Oh.
A:	you just draw it
A:	and they have to zoom out and zoom in
A:	and, you know, it's like, every time that you have to do something is, it's really a pain.
B:	What a hassle,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, also, you know, it's like for, for presentations,
A:	it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a, on a P C.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it can be easily represented on a, on a P C.
A:	You know, like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this, all these numbers.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, with a, with a new system I can calculate everything so fast, you know, like for spread sheets.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	You can see what the trend is over the years.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, I love all the windows that they have out now too,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that
B:	they have really simplified things.
A:	I, I had a, I had a program due
A:	and uh, one, one window I had the program
A:	and the other one I had the program running. so if there was ever a mistake, I could easily check, you know,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	I could look at the program and say, this is where I made the error.
B:	Right.
A:	Instead of saying, where did I make the error?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, go back and forth
A:	and, and, you know, you always, you know,
A:	the old ones you had to go out of your program, load up, um, uh, well load up the program again, in this case.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	After you load it up change it, hope that's right, get out of that, run the program, run, uh-huh, as long as it took, and then go back and see if that worked or not.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But with windows you can have the program
A:	and say it messed up in line fifty-four.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you take a look at line fifty-four,
A:	you take a look at the output at the same time,
A:	and you can see that, where it messed up, because, you know it's like in the old computers, the ones that, uh, we're using here a couple of years ago, you would always have to have a printout,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know, I, uh, I remember my college days And having to do that too.
A:	did, did you learn it in computer science?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I sure did.
A:	And, when was this.
B:	Uh, I graduated in eighty-six.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So it's been fairly recent.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know because, uh, all I know is that when I came here in eighty-seven, they still had, uh, it was the last year to, to put all your punch cards in.
B:	The cards.
B:	Oh, oh dear.
B:	I didn't have to bother with that at all, thank goodness.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, yeah.
A:	No,
A:	but it, it was just sensational because I walked in
A:	and they go, Oh, my God, they're still using this.
B:	Yes.
A:	It was like, this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out
A:	and, you know You can get a hard copy of it,
B:	Wow,
B:	wow.
A:	and that's about it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	wow.
A:	So. But, I mean, the price of computers has gone down.
A:	They said that, um, if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since, you know, it started, they said that, uh, cars would cost two dollars
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they would run forever.
B:	Oh, that would be great.
A:	So, I mean it's like, you know, the, the joke with the Yugo, you know,
A:	it's like, yeah, you know, like when your, uh, car runs out of gas just throw it away.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, that, that's the way it would be.
B:	Wow.
A:	It's like yeah, I think I'll buy a new car today, you know,
A:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I mean the price has really gone down.
A:	I mean, I B M which, uh,
A:	an I B M P C in like in nineteen eighty-one it would cost you five thousand dollars,
B:	Oh, sure,
B:	oh, sure.
A:	and now you can get it, you know, like for, one thousand dollars, because, you know, because of the parts basically.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and the two eighty-six too,
B:	so, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	The parts and the labor is what they're charging you,
A:	they're not charging you, you know, over pricing, it because it's like, if we sell it for less, you know, it's like we're losing money, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	It's like we want to sell it to break even at least.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, I think they stopped producing the I B M P C.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, and the, uh, P C Junior was a total failure, to them.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They had, uh,
A:	they're trying to get out small computers,
A:	but, the only problem was that when they took that one out, the small computer was the I B M P C
A:	And, so, you couldn't, you know,
A:	it's like, sure bring out. into the market something that's smaller when nobody uses anything that's smaller than, you know, this, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, so.
B:	Oh. Uh-huh.
A:	But, over the past years it's like I B M has been producing like
A:	every two years they bring out a whole new system. You know, like the P C X T, A T, and the P S one, P S two things, you know,
A:	and so. It's just that you have to always compete
A:	and, uh, Mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because of, of their, you know,
A:	you can work with it a lot easier.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	So, that's what they're trying to do.
A:	Oh, well, I'll leave you back to your work.
B:	Well.
B:	Okay.
A:	And, uh, have a good lunch.
B:	Thanks.
B:	Bye.
A:	All right,
A:	bye, bye.
A:	All right.
A:	Now, we used to be big time campers
A:	but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What type of camping did you do?
A:	Well when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we went like twenty or thirty at a time.
A:	We took, uh, just our little tents,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we did it that way.
A:	Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and we did it that way.
B:	Oh, how neat.
A:	So, we've always enjoyed camping.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I know I have, um, I just have a tent,
B:	and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then I bought a van
B:	and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable
A:	yes.
A:	Now we have friends with a van,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like one night
A:	and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they enjoy it.
B:	Yes,
B:	I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, you know, when it comes, to camping.
A:	Oh,
A:	really, that's television
A:	I don't know
A:	in general on this project we're suppose to talk about
A:	so I mean,
B:	Yeah
B:	I'm sorry.
A:	That's okay,
A:	don't,
A:	I mean, I, I always .
B:	Well, it's hard to talk about something,
B:	it's like me talking about taxes or something,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I feel bad cause I mean,  I should know something about T V shows.
A:	Oh, that's okay.
A:	I had one lady one time
A:	they called in
A:	I just signed up
A:	my husband had been on this project, um,
A:	and I, I, she called in
A:	and it was all about, we don't have children and it was all about, um, sending your kids to college,  and why you would advise them.
A:	And she was from Boston,
A:	and she, I shouldn't talk about this but she was, pretend she was a television show,
A:	and she was very snooty
A:	and, uh, her kids were going to places like Amherst and B U
A:	and I said I didn't know what that was
A:	I she went, oh,
A:	and I thought, um,
A:	so I know,
A:	I mean it's like don't worry about it
A:	television at least, you know, everybody's,  at least seen television. During the war did you laugh when they had that man on,
A:	uh, what was his name Wolf Blitzer?
B:	What was that?
A:	That guy that was a reporter for C N N.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	His name is Wolf Blitzer.
A:	Did you see it, him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf?
B:	Um, I might of.
B:	I forget.
B:	Was he the guy that got captured?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	that was the other guy from C B S,
A:	oh,  what was his name, uh,
B:	Oh.
A:	I can't remember his name.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but what about this Wolf guy?
A:	Yeah,
A:	but just ,
A:	they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that,
B:	Oh.
A:	Jay Leno.
B:	You know, what my absolutely favorite show is?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	DAVID LETTERMAN.
B:	I love that guy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's funny.
B:	And SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,
B:	I use to watch that
B:	like I'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half,
B:	he's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	I mean I haven't seen it in a couple of months
A:	but,
B:	Has it gotten better?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	actually I think it has,
A:	I mean they finally like
A:	and some of those people
A:	they really have funny characters on there.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they have one character on there
A:	they just call it Pat
A:	and they, you don't know if it's a man or a woman
A:	And they say well, they're trying to deduce what he or she is,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse
A:	and Pat says no
A:	I carry a fanny pack
A:	So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man,
A:	or now days, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	it's weird
B:	That's funny.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, yeah it is pretty funny
A:	I mean they do some crazy things.
B:	Like when WAYNE'S WORLD,
B:	I love that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	WAYNE'S WORLD, hey man
A:	And what's that other one where they, where they do the, um, skits,
A:	well, you've must have seen it recently?
B:	Well, I don't know,
B:	I've seen it off and on, I think.
A:	You probably have some friends that have television
B:	Uh?
A:	I said you probably have some friends that have television
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	That's where I've seen it
B:	because I've seen it off and on probably.
A:	You know, I mean you're not totally out of the loop.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, yeah.
B:	We, we bug our we, you know,
B:	one friend of ours got rid of his because we motivated him because we, you know, cause we were getting along out ours
B:	so he sold his.
B:	But the rest of our friends we go and watch them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean you really, you can do without one
A:	but after awhile it will start, um, you know,
A:	I mean you just kind of all of sudden
A:	cause you're going well jeez
A:	you hear about something that somebody else talked about,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you just end up doing it
A:	but if you haven't been married that long, you know,  you're doing other things
B:	Is that on tape?
A:	Is that on tape,
A:	there you go,
A:	yeah.
B:	That's funny.
A:	Oh, my
A:	what else is on
A:	I don't know
A:	what did they watch in college when you where in,
A:	where did you go to school?
B:	Oh, Purdue.
A:	Oh, that's a good school.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know about that.
A:	They don't have a southern accent up there though.
B:	No.
A:	You must be native Texan?
B:	Why
B:	do I, Do I have a southern accent?
A:	Well your from Indiana, yeah. *your should be you're
A:	Oh, real southern,
A:	yeah.
B:	Are you serious?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've been here three years.
A:	Deep one, you have a deep one,
A:	yeah
B:	Oh, wow,
B:	that's scary.
A:	It is, um,
A:	at Purdue
A:	I'm trying to think, I went to high school in Chicago, I'm trying to think what Purdue kids watch.
B:	We watch, uh, M T V twenty four hours a day
B:	and then every now and then they'd DAYS, they taped DAYS, you know,  and watch it like four or five times a day.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	That's the girls I lived with
B:	and, you know, other then that I'm sure they watched,
A:	Do you know that I've never, I think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something,  like entertainment tonight I've never seen M T V?
B:	Yeah.
B:	You aren't missing anything
A:	That's kind of what I've heard
B:	It's pretty bad.
A:	I mean that's,
A:	yeah.
B:	Especially if you have kids.
B:	Don't let them watch it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	No
A:	we don't
A:	and I wouldn't even I mean I don't even have cable
A:	I don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay,  somebody, uh, to, you know, give me a hundred and fifty, um  channel access to something I'm never going to,
B:	No.
A:	I mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time
A:	and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids
A:	I swear to God he works from eight,
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, I heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime.
B:	Well, you know, you know last night I was listening to the, uh, ten o'clock news.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings, the number of drug deals that were going on, and crime
B:	and, and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	The same way here in Dennison.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, uh, back a couple weeks ago they found, uh, some people I don't remember at some fast food restaurant.
A:	They had been, I can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer
A:	but I'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast, food restaurant.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I've worked, worked in fast food restaurants.
A:	They don't have that much money on hand,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they really don't.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I did too.
B:	I remember I used to work at, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and I just couldn't believe, um, you know, that
B:	now I would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, because of, uh, the crime
B:	that they would, um, kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there, uh, in their cash drawer.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	My husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he, well I don't know, he decided not to work one night or something
A:	and one of the guys that was working was shot,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, Kenny quit the next day.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He just, he couldn't deal with it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	yeah.
B:	Oh, I understand what your talking about.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	I have, uh, uh, you know, a real problem, uh,
B:	even though I live further out in the suburbs, the crime follows you anywhere,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Everywhere.
B:	it, it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, so, but, I just think about the all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from,
A:	It just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the worst part of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I lived in Louisville, Kentucky for a while,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, I lived on the outskirts too,
A:	but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the, uh, Kentucky Derby.
B:	Yeah.
A:	At this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, I don't know, um, you know,
B:	it's asking about what kind of steps we can take, um, uh, you know, just as citizens to try and, um, uh, protect ourselves.
B:	I know I have, uh, um, home security system.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Plus, I have the, uh, the special lights on, on the outside.
B:	And I have,
A:	The ones that blink off and on.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, uh,
A:	By themselves I mean.
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	By themselves
B:	if you if there's some kind of movement, then they'll automatically come on. Um,
A:	Right.
B:	but, I mean it's just I'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected, verses, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	How many kids do you have?
B:	Two.
B:	Two.
A:	Oh
A:	a boy or?
B:	One of each.
A:	Oh, that's what I've got,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It is scary,
A:	are your are they babies or,
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	there teenagers now.
A:	Oh, well good. That they're a comfort to you.
A:	I've still got babies.
A:	Okay
B:	Yeah
A:	I've got a, a four year old. He'll be four. And a three month old.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	And it's scary sometimes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's a problem.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm used to living in, uh,
A:	which
A:	we don't live in the city,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we just.
A:	It's still more crowded than what I'm used to,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm used to having, you know, eight or ten houses on one street
A:	and this one's got houses on either side and, you know, real close together,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and just,
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's different,
B:	yeah,
B:	living down here.
B:	Now, now the nice thing, uh,
B:	I feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this. Um,
B:	I, I feel like that there's going to be, uh, less crime
B:	or your neighbors going to be watching out for you, um, because it's, it's practically, it's in their backyard, too,
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, oh well,
A:	we think our neighbors are stealing from us, actually my husband.
A:	They, uh, well, the one of them's a teenager that lives next door
A:	and her friends are pretty wild.
A:	They've stolen gas out of our vehicles.
B:	Oh goodness.
A:	And so he went and got a locking gas cap for his.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They weren't stealing it out of mine so much, because my car, the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to, syphon gas out.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So he, he went and got a locking cap
A:	and they tried to break that off.
B:	Oh my goodness.
A:	And you excuse me. He went down to Uba , and noticed that it was hanging off where, where they had tried to break it off.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they stole our tailgate off his truck
B:	Oh goodness.
A:	Well, we can't say they did
A:	but,
B:	Someone did,
A:	We're pretty,
A:	yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it had to be somebody that, you know, could do it in the middle of the night
A:	and, you know, they'd seen it earlier.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	I know that it's a real problem.
B:	It doesn't matter where you are anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, uh, more of a matter of what you, the steps that you do to keep yourself safe,
B:	and um, so that's, that's why I try and, uh, do,
A:	Well, the only thing that we can do as citizens is, you know, like, uh, watch groups that they'll have.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But they can be dangerous too.
B:	Really.
A:	I've thought about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, that this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody
A:	you can get yourself into trouble.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I was going home the other day
B:	and I saw, um, a guy who, who looked like he was breaking into a window,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I thought, gee whiz, you know, I don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's, he's the person who lives there. Uh,
B:	you know, and, and I was thinking well, I need to call the police when I get back home
B:	and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live
B:	and, uh, and I thought no, you know, because I wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight.
B:	But anymore, you know, the crime happens in daylight, as it does in, in night,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I watched it on T V, oh, I guess last year sometime.
A:	They'll break in at the day, in the daytime,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, I hear that, you know, it's if you lock yourself out of your house
A:	and you try to get in your house
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it will
A:	you give
A:	that half the time it takes you to break in.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, a professional could break in, in, half that time.
B:	Half that time,
B:	wow.
B:	I mean that's so scary.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is.
B:	So scary you, you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe,
B:	and, and, uh, somebody could break in, uh,
B:	oh I have a dog,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that's the one thing that I like.
A:	I'm getting me, uh, I want a German Shepherd.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I don't want any of those ones that will up the kids,
B:	Right.
A:	but I do want a German Shepherd.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because my husband will leave every once in a while, for,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	he works on the railroad.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm scared here by myself.
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	So that's uh,
B:	we have a little dog now
B:	but he is just as vicious as is, you know, if you,
A:	And loud.
B:	And loud,
B:	yeah,
B:	and I thought that, uh, you know, we'd have to have a big dog
B:	but we doesn't need a big dog.
B:	We got this little bitty dog that, uh,
B:	part Dachshunds and part Cocker Spaniel.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he, um, ease very protective,
A:	The Cocker Spaniels are loud
A:	Well that's, now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog.
B:	yeah.
B:	Very protective,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's a deterrent.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because they know that that dog's going to bark.
B:	That's right.
A:	But it's easy to fool a dog too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know, throw them meat or
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat.
B:	Right.
A:	From what I've
A:	you know, saw it on T V.
B:	Oh, wow, gosh.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was.
B:	Okay.
A:	And I, maybe we'll meet up again.
B:	Okay.
A:	All righty.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	there's one, uh,
A:	I meant living in Texas,
A:	where you at?
B:	I'm in Rome, New York.
A:	In where Rome , New York?
B:	Rome, New York,
B:	yeah.
A:	Rome, New York,
A:	okay, well, Texas,
A:	let me look at my husband and ask him, to some one else in
A:	Yes,
A:	they do
A:	He's reminding me of where I live,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I,
B:	New York does not
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, they're, they're trying to reinstate it
B:	and the governor's opposed to it being that, uh, the Democrat that he is,  and Mario Cuomo
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea
A:	but, or I should say morally I don't like the idea,
A:	but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
B:	I'd, I would agree, with that even more,
B:	I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically
B:	but I'm really offended,  by the thought that I have to support,  uh, just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist,  you know,  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested children, and kill,  them whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, upwards , uh, thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	any ,  on the street,
A:	no,
A:	I know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and Texas is having a problem right now
A:	and it's, the, the, the, the, the I think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from from killing police officers to, I mean just multiple, you know, molestations to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things
A:	and they're get, these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,
B:	Right.
A:	and now, they can't find them
A:	and they're finding bodies in you know,
A:	I mean, you think why they say it's because you're over crowd, it's over crowded,
A:	and you think how is, is everybody that stupid
A:	or is the world really that rotten
B:	I, I don't know,
A:	I know.
B:	it's a hard question,
B:	you look at the United States,
B:	we have the largest murder rate of any developed, uh,
A:	And then,
B:	or, uh,
A:	I don't know how Americans are about handguns
A:	but, uh, yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that, uh, in the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, they had been, uh, looking at a bill, uh, making it easier to accept the bill to access, to access handguns
A:	and they passed it, which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
B:	Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh
A:	Is it,
A:	that's good.
B:	it takes, uh, it takes almost six months to get, uh, handgun permit, in this state.
A:	Say, that good,
A:	I think that's, like the state of Virginia,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's great.
B:	Now, the, the,
B:	and that's with, uh,
B:	you have to have, uh, oh, a police investigation,
B:	you have to,  have references,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I know it,
B:	there is, it's very easy to get, uh, uh, you know,
B:	there's no restrictions, whatsoever, on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that,  which aren't the, I, I don't consider to be the kind of crime, uh,  weapon, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	they're no,
A:	the cattiness behind,
A:	right,
A:	yeah,
B:	uh, so,
A:	I mean I don't like guns in general
A:	but when I think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was in college in a dorm
A:	and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him
A:	but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
B:	Right.
A:	and how they just
A:	well, it hasn't been just
A:	but it was in the, I think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety
B:	Right.
A:	and I had, you know, I knew some people that said, why are you glad,
A:	you you know,
A:	this is nothing,
A:	and I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that
A:	but I actually, I mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a I might be too cold too, but they flip a switch,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	I don't know,
B:	well, and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped
A:	I mean,
B:	and then
A:	So many times.
B:	yeah
A:	Yeah.
B:	and did it again
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, they said celebrated that, uh,
A:	he's not the only one,  you know,
B:	No.
A:	you, you see somebody's mini series
A:	and you hear about somebody's crime,
A:	there was something on,
A:	and this gets back to capital punishment,
A:	but the man had stolen, uh, not stolen but kidnapped, uh, some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida
A:	and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they buried her alive
B:	Oh, God.
A:	and Peter Strauss had played the lead role
A:	and the man, and, and at the end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this set person was paroled like six months ago
A:	and you're thinking oh, that's nice.
B:	Great.
A:	I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence
A:	but it does serve as a uh, definite,  you know, lasting
B:	Surely,  there's and end to, the situation.
A:	Right,
A:	in that particular instance, uh,
A:	but I, but I don't, but I know it's on a
A:	and all and be all,
B:	Right.
A:	that's the problem I have with it,
A:	in Texas they think it's
A:	and all and be all,
A:	they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have
A:	and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we just moved here, uh,
A:	we've been here before, lived in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate,
A:	and then we were transferred back here,
A:	and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic just living is,  even suburban, no matter where you are,
B:	Right.
A:	and how,
A:	you're in,  Rome, New York,
B:	Rome, New York,
B:	it's up state
B:	it it's, uh, near Syracuse
A:	is that
A:	and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,
B:	it's about, uh,
B:	well, I, I actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach,
B:	I work in Rome, uh,
A:	What, what type of area is that,
B:	It's more rural,
A:	is that in term,
B:	uh, it use to be use to be a, uh, uh, have a lot of heavy industry,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's kind of, uh,
B:	all the industry has gone south,
A:	Sure.
B:	and, uh, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, uh, area
B:	and, uh, uh,  so it's,   Not too bad,
A:	How would,  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and,  and things that would,
B:	it, you know, you still have the, uh, more drug problems and typical,  uh, small city type problems,
A:	not too bad.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I don't know that there's a real, uh,
A:	Not the harsh criminality,  that you find in,
B:	no
B:	there isn't the harsh crime and all.
A:	yeah,
A:	now, Dallas is a
A:	I'm being very sarcastic,
A:	it's just a great,  uh,
A:	on some days, uh, it's, uh, I don't know
A:	the good ole boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said
A:	they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,  deed for deed that,  that does something, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that,
A:	I mean, they really are over,  crowded,
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, that's, that's just not a cop out, uh,
A:	and I just, you know, I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days,
A:	I'm not sure if they, I don't think they have capital punishment there.
B:	I think, I think Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it
B:	because I'm from, uh,  from Pennsylvania also, just, uh, just outside,  of Philadelphia,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I'm from Pittsburgh
A:	so,  oh, well, we'll forgive each other
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up
A:	I and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty,  years
B:	Right.
A:	but, uh,
B:	The west part of the state is
B:	and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases
B:	so.
A:	There you go
A:	I don't know
A:	that's a different subject,  altogether
B:	Right.
A:	but, uh, I don't know
A:	I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime.
A:	I think everyone would,
A:	you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it on, in this,  vehicle, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out,  I think every human does, I think they'd say, yeah,
B:	Sure.
A:	do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me, you know,
B:	Yeah,
A:	uh,
B:	if your friends or family got, uh, had that happen to them I think everyone would,
B:	I, they'd,  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face,  as they did it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I just,  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate,
A:	I mean I just don't, uh, oh,
A:	I did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class,
A:	and I just,
A:	the subject,
A:	I remember we drew things out of a hat
A:	and it was something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment
A:	and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape, rapist getting their hand,  just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session,  you know, all these, uh, intangible things
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	and you're thinking, oh, you would not only would you not want to be a victim
A:	you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting, uh
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	but, I don't know,
A:	methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on that either
A:	I just
B:	Well, uh, I, uh, yeah,
B:	I don't know
B:	I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless
B:	because I guess it's a pretty,  pretty rough thing to be, uh, electrocuted.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is it, uh,
A:	how about the injection,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	an injection,
A:	is that suppose to be.
B:	yeah,
B:	that would be even,
B:	yeah,
B:	I didn't even, think about that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states,
A:	do you know which way it is the ratio,
A:	it's more than,
A:	aren't, uh,
A:	it's more that don't have it,
B:	I think,
A:	isn't that correct.
B:	yeah,
B:	there's more that don't have it
B:	but amazingly it's like, uh, Massachusetts went back,  and reinstated capital punishment, oh, maybe six or seven years ago,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it
B:	but, uh, it's on the books.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know if they've, they did something about
A:	I'm not sure if Texas,
A:	Minnesota,
A:	I, they didn't, they didn't, they were
A:	well, did they have it,
A:	they were against it, uh,
A:	Texas, as I said, has it
A:	but I haven't been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,  if they've done it in the last,
B:	Right.
A:	Well, I guess it depends on what age.
A:	I am in the thirty something,
A:	so I know,
A:	I mean I lived through it.
A:	Uh, are you old enough to know about the war?
B:	Uh, just barely.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am, uh, twenty-nine.
A:	Okay.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	you are old enough.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But
A:	But it was on the fringe.
B:	just, uh, yeah,
B:	exactly.
B:	Had some friends that were, that were in it.
A:	It ended, uh, when I was in, uh, college. In, uh, when I turned nineteen in nineteen seventy,
A:	I cannot even remember at this point. Uh,
A:	when I turned nineteen it was the year that, uh, the draft was still going on.
A:	If I had been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah
B:	Wowie!
A:	So I learned a lesson in gender
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, in terms of the war, I do not know. Uh,
A:	actually I do not really know that much about it.
A:	I just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media, you know. Uh,
A:	I guess I think it was, uh, uh, not that great that we were in there, uh, in terms of for how long it lasted.
B:	Right.
A:	You know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you think?
B:	Well, I think it is, uh, basically the same way.
B:	It is certainly has affected, uh, U S policy though.
B:	There is, there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the, the thing in, uh, Iraq.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because, uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq.
B:	I mean it was, uh, one country picking on a smaller, weaker one.
A:	Right.
A:	The devastation,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The only difference was that the government said, okay
B:	if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent.
B:	And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And in full faction,
B:	Which, uh,
A:	yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam.
B:	It was sort of, of a president's war rather than a country's war.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it just kind of dragged on.
A:	Uh, I do not know how you were historically.
A:	But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It seemed to me like it was, it seemed like it was going on forever,
A:	I mean, I
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	It really, well,
A:	yeah,
A:	in fact, because in terms of when your,
A:	there is at least ten years between us,
A:	so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure that it was, you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, one of the things I did not like was the weapons, the weapons, I can't even say it, the weaponry systems that they used.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, it just did not seem that, uh, I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either.
B:	Right.
A:	And then you heard about the things like agent orange, et cetera,
A:	and you would think, you know, just, uh, how could the government or the Pentagon, uh, or whomever is in charge there been so careless.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	Uh,
B:	Of course now uh, now everyone's more, uh, you know, environmentally uh, intelligent than they were back then.
A:	Conscious,
A:	yeah.
B:	I mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people that people know about themselves now.
A:	Nutrisweet,
A:	yeah,
A:	and all these other things.
A:	That is true, uh,
A:	Uh, monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, uh, Vietnamese people as a whole. Uh, in South Vietnam, in general, in helping them restore themselves.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there
B:	Yeah.
B:	I do not know if they, uh, I do not know if they have that resource or not.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean I do not think they do.
A:	But I just think it is kind of a shame that, uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	uh, so on a whole, I do not know, war is not good.
A:	And that one I probably,
A:	uh, my main opinion would be we should not have done it.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, that is what I know about the Vietnam War
B:	Yeah.
A:	Unless you,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, you know a little, uh, a little bit more than I do,
B:	explain it.
B:	I did not, uh, get to live through it.
B:	That the people that I know that it did, uh, felt very strongly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Most of,
B:	I work for a government contractor.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So most of the guys I work with, are, uh, oh, at least some of the guys I work with rather are veterans.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, Vietnam?
B:	And, uh, from Vietnam.
A:	Jeez,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, I have not talked to any of them that, that were not, you know, glad that they went or, or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, most of them are very strongly that, that the reason for America to be there was a good one.
A:	And that, that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They just felt that the way America backed them up was not, was not at all right.
A:	In terms of the personal.
B:	Yeah.
B:	In term of, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Personal level
B:	and, and the finances, how they started. You know,
B:	like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because the Congress would not approve, you know.
A:	The money is
B:	So, Yeah.
A:	after,
A:	yeah.
A:	I mean, I think it started actually like, like in the late fifties. I mean like in fifty-eight, fifty-nine.
B:	Huh.
B:	I, I,
A:	So it really,
A:	I mean, because I know, in nineteen sixty-three, I mean I was nine years old, when Kennedy was shot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I mean I remember, uh, right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam.
A:	But then as I got older and studied in school, I realized it was even going on before that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, and you think to yourself, oh, my goodness, Eisenhower
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	That sounds ancient,
A:	yeah.
A:	And I know, I know, you know, a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties, uh, guys that I know, that, they are just kind of bitter, you know.
A:	They, they, you know,
A:	I hate to that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,
A:	but it is that kind of idea.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, they just do not feel that socially they were given,
A:	like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome.
B:	Right,
A:	Yeah.
A:	They were not given the,
B:	right,
B:	the ticker tape parade and all that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, well, I won't keep you any more.
B:	Okay.
A:	That is probably as about as much as we both know
A:	But thanks for talking to me.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh, were you calling from Texas?
A:	Uh, yes,
A:	is that where you are at?
B:	No,
B:	I am in Falls Church, Virginia.
A:	Oh, I know where that is.
A:	That is beautiful where you are at.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right in, right near D C.
A:	D C,
A:	yeah.
A:	Are you a native of there?
B:	Uh, pretty much,
B:	yep.
B:	Been,
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, Dallas, it is, uh, ninety-two degrees here today,
A:	but at least the humidity is, uh, below forty percent, which makes it kind of like Phoenix.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It is about the same weather here.
A:	Really?
B:	Little bit, little bit cooler, like eighty-nine.
A:	Well, you,
B:	But, basically the same thing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well you are not missing too much then
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	Really.
A:	Well, take it easy.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, do you want to give a start on it?
B:	Well, I think for me,
B:	I, I'm from Alabama.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	South Alabama,
B:	and so I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement. Uh, in a pretty liberal family for, for that area at the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so I was very much a part of all the, uh you know, what was going on there.
A:	Uh-uh.
B:	Uh, my parents are pretty active
B:	and, uh, it was very scary
B:	and, but now we've seen, you know, uh, black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and I guess all over than they did, you know, twenty years ago.
A:	Oh, definitely.
B:	There's still a lot to be you know, to be accomplished,
B:	but for me, when I think about social change, that's what I first think of
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because I can remember, you know, separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You can relate to that.
A:	Now see, we didn't, we don't have any of that because, well, like, we live in the country in Clarion County
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, we really didn't have things like that going on that we, you know, uh, ran into.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we kind of, uh,
A:	I guess when I think of social changes, I think, think more of, uh uh, visiting habits of families and such.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's true.
A:	Uh,
B:	That's a good one right there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that there's less visiting done, I think, on a whole than there used to be.
A:	Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not,
A:	you went visiting
A:	And, uh, today, you know, people, they do visit,
A:	but it's not quite the same as, uh, what it was, say, twenty years ago, thirty years ago.
B:	Right.
B:	And I grew up in, out in the country, too, basically, in a rural area and with lots of family.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And so we were always at family in different family members' homes.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But even now, you know, they don't even do that.
A:	Well, they're so spread out,
A:	I think has a lot to do with it.
B:	Well, and they're so busy.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	People, people's personal schedules are so busy.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Mainly because, I, a lot of it has to do, I think with more women working
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	in our family, you know, twenty years ago, not that many of the women worked.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah.
B:	And now, uh, almost all the women work.
A:	The majority,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, so that means, you know, a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was, I think, probably instigated by women at that time.
A:	Probably,
A:	because when you work you don't really care to go out and visit as much.
B:	Right.
B:	And now,
B:	That's right.
A:	And, uh,
B:	And now, uh,
B:	I mean my mother does not work
B:	and, and she, you know, she's finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But even just social visits, people don't do that anymore.
B:	You're right.
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh,
A:	they don't do as much.
B:	And people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There's a real,
A:	You have to make arrangements or have an invitation or,
B:	Right,
B:	you know, you don't want to, You want to make sure it's okay
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I guess we don't not to make, invade people's privacy or whatever.
A:	Well, that could be part of it.
A:	I don't know for sure what it is.
A:	I know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance, so we really don't have that even.
A:	We don't,
B:	Well, out of, out of fifteen grandchildren in my family, only two of us don't live within fifty miles.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And and most live within ten or, or twenty.
A:	Oh, that's pretty good.
B:	So, but that's, you know, that is rural, it's a rural family
B:	and most people didn't go away.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the, you know, even in the same state.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, apparently there must be work available, for those that are,
B:	Yeah.
B:	There is in that area.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because around here, there's really nothing for the young people,
A:	no good, I mean there's jobs.
A:	There's minimum wage jobs,
A:	but, uh, to make a good living, there really, around here, there just isn't too much.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I guess, you know, that would greatly affect social i. e., social change.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Probably the job market has and the, the economy has always affected, uh, social change.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Probably.
A:	So, well, there's the main things I can think of.
A:	I really tried to think of some other things
A:	and I couldn't really,
B:	Well, I think just, also, you know, the women's movement, too, has affected a lot of social change.
A:	Yeah,
A:	definitely.
B:	Uh, people marry,
A:	Some good and some bad
B:	Yeah.
B:	People marry later.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean basically, I think,
B:	now, again, where I'm from in, in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But now out here in Texas where I am now, that's very unusual.
A:	They'd rather get their life started first before,
B:	Most people get I mean get, go to college or at least get a job
B:	and even, you know, people are, seem to, a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, even to get school finished, I think,
A:	a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in.
A:	Because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration
A:	and if you're busy with school it's, I think it's really difficult for a family.
B:	Right.
B:	But probably, uh, you know, more women being in, in the work force also greatly, greatly affects social change.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Because it affects child care
B:	and,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	Uh
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know my, my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh, she has two little boys
A:	and they, they've been in day care since, you know,
A:	one's four
A:	and one's one
B:	Right.
A:	and they've done well
A:	Now, I wouldn't want to do it that way,
A:	but, uh, she's quite happy
A:	and the children seem quite adjusted.
B:	Well, and they're, you know, they're, they're saying right now, we don't know what, we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah.
B:	And so, you know, it remained to be seen exactly what that, what that does.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, I'm going to baby-sit my granddaughter.
A:	She's just eight weeks old,
A:	so this will be new for me
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, but the others I'm too far away to help them out at all.
B:	Where do they live?
A:	Uh, well, I have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh. One in Maryland and one in Connecticut.
A:	A son in Connecticut.
B:	Well, they're not too far, though.
A:	No,
A:	but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home
A:	and, uh, it's too far to, you know, really go too often.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pittsburgh's not quite so bad.
A:	It's just a couple hours.
A:	Maryland, maybe five hour drive.
B:	Well, I live like fourteen hours from home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's worse yet.
B:	In fact I'm, I'm driving I'm, I'm driving home tomorrow, so,
A:	Oh, are you really?
B:	To go be there for the Fourth of July.
A:	Do you, uh, stay overnight on the way,
A:	or you,
B:	No,
B:	I can drive it all.
B:	It's just me,
A:	You're young.
B:	So I can make it.
A:	How old are you?
B:	I'm thirty-five.
A:	Okay,
A:	well you're young enough yet to
B:	Although it's, it's, it is pretty,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I don't enjoy it that much.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's pretty much like get there
B:	and,
A:	It's work to get there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just not that pleasant.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Even with other people, I basically just don't like to drive that far.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now my son,
A:	they, they, flew,
A:	he rebuilt a Aranca Chief, airplane,
A:	and they flew down last weekend.
A:	They came down in it.
A:	And it still took a long time because it's not a fast, it's not a high-speed airplane.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But they enjoyed in thoroughly.
A:	So,
B:	When you say you're in the second phase of this project, what is the second phase of it?
A:	I'm not sure,
A:	but you have to change phones.
A:	You have to call from another, a different,
B:	Oh.
A:	Wondering how you keep up on the news.
B:	Primarily with our local newspaper and T V.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I listen to the radio but not, um, not like I did when I was working.
B:	I am recently retired
B:	to that means I have a lot of time to watch the news on T V.
B:	How do you gain your news?
A:	I guess the, I get the WASHINGTON POST
B:	Okay.
A:	and that is a pretty big newspaper
A:	and I think that's almost exclusive me, my first of the news.
A:	Though I have the radio on when I go to work, I don't think the news usually hits,
A:	because I'm not going right on the hour.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	You know.
B:	Well, that's, that is one of the handicaps with both T V and, and radio.
B:	If you're not available on the hour or half hour, then you lose out on an awful lot.
B:	Well, what is your newspaper?
B:	That is the WASHINGTON POST
A:	Right.
B:	is that correct?
B:	I have read that when we were in that area,
B:	and it is a splendid newspaper.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, what more do we need to discuss tonight?
B:	That seems like a very short one.
A:	Right.
A:	I think that, you know, we, we've resolved the issue
A:	and that's what we were asked to do.
B:	Well, I can discuss a lot of the news that we have,
B:	but, uh, I feel that that's not part of our responsibility.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So thank you for calling.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Well, thanks for discussing it.
B:	All right.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, Carolyn, the, uh, one of the main things I'd like, like to know is, uh, how do you feel about the, knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth.
B:	Well.
A:	What do you think would be required, and so forth?
B:	Uh, I'll tell you,
B:	I, I watched what went on, um, with the TWENTY TWENTY show, I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that, that talked about nursing homes,
B:	and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,
B:	and
A:	Oh, you knew of the homes, then.
B:	Pardon?
A:	You knew of the homes themselves?
B:	Well, I,
B:	no,
B:	I'm not familiar with those homes per se
A:	Uh-huh
B:	but, um, they were in the area where I live uh,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,
B:	so I would definitely, you know, want to really check things out and, uh, go,
B:	I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, to, to make sure that you went daily, you know and made sure that they were cared for,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Well, from your point of view, how would you feel about actually sending someone that, that's, you know, means something to you to one of those homes.
A:	I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, of course, that makes sense,
A:	but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new, new home situation?
B:	Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,
B:	and she's eighty-seven
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	and, uh, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I know how she feels about it.
B:	You know, if I, uh if I ever had to put her there, I think, uh, it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more, you know, if I she got to the point where she was totally bedridden, and, and I mean, I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that would be the,
A:	Well, how do you find that your, your personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal?
A:	Does that, does that cause any problems between the two of you?
B:	Uh, I wouldn't say any more than usual.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is she,
B:	I think it's very hard for her, um, to be waited upon, so to speak,
B:	I mean, I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to.
A:	It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, at the level that you did before,
A:	isn't it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's very true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, on the other hand, it takes on almost a, a switch of a mother child relationship.
A:	It is different.
B:	Uh.
A:	I had that almost similar situation.
A:	My mother lives in an apartment with my sister
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, so I, except for the three or four months this summer,
A:	that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,
A:	and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled to have her here with me,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, uh, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her, her life as though she were on vacation.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But somehow another, it, that doesn't work between my mom and my sister,
A:	and they, they find they, they are,
A:	in speaking they,
A:	I don't know,
A:	my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,
A:	and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it's, it puts, has put pressure on both of them from that point of view.
A:	So that's, that's kind of bad news.
A:	And by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home,
A:	and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years
B:	Um.
A:	and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She's relatively happy,
A:	but she doesn't like the food.
A:	And when she complains about the food then they kind of get angry with her.
B:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,
B:	and then go to something like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	after all, their, their life is so totally different
A:	because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, you raised your own chickens,
A:	and you killed your own hogs, I suppose,
A:	and then they they had to store the meat in, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't want to say barns,
A:	but they had regular little places they, they would hang it, you know to cure it and so forth.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and now, all of a sudden, it, uh, comes in differently,
A:	it tastes differently.
B:	That's right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you have a, do you have any, uh, major preferences as far as television?
A:	T V, uh,
A:	trying to think.
A:	I was trying to think of some while they were calling you. Uh,
A:	I like Friday,
A:	what is it,
A:	is it Friday or Saturday night shows
A:	I think it's Friday night.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	All the, uh, the one with the two little girls in it, what's it called.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, oh,
A:	Or three little girls.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the, the two twins play the, the twins play that one that the youngest girl.
A:	Right.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I really like that.
A:	What's it called?
B:	Uh, I don't know,
B:	all I can think of is the name of ALL IN THE FAMILY
B:	but that's not it.
B:	FULL HOUSE.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there you go.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I really like that show.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is good.
B:	I, I like, uh,
B:	we have cable.
B:	I really like watching the old NICK AT NITE shows, you know. Where you get to watch DRAGNET and MISTER ED
A:	Oh.
B:	and, uh, we, we can watch those all night sometimes if,
B:	DONNA REED
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, lately I've been getting into talk shows
A:	and
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah,
A:	just, you know, controversy and,
B:	Which which one does, which ones do you like?
A:	Just really whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just as long,
A:	it depends on the subject actually.
B:	Right.
A:	Where, where it's more interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some of them get pretty boring
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, there's that guy,
B:	I think it's out of Dallas,
B:	his name is, uh, oh,
B:	I wish I could remember his name.
A:	Is he one of the talk show guys?
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's, he's black
A:	Maury Povich?
B:	no,
B:	he's black
B:	and has a bald head
B:	and his first name starts with an M.
A:	Huh, let's see.
B:	Oh, it's like,
B:	his first name's like Marlo or Marlin,
B:	I can't remember his name.
B:	Anyway, he always has like really strange shows like, uh, uh, male strippers or female strippers or just really sensationalistic, you know, like what Geraldo used to be.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, I don't, I don't like those,
A:	I like more controversial subjects, I think.
B:	I don't either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I mean, yeah
B:	Do you watch cartoons a lot?
A:	No.
B:	No.
A:	I'm, I don't watch T V that much, uh, anymore.
A:	It seems like, uh,
A:	I'm going to school right now
A:	so,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	where do you go to school?
A:	B Y U.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, and I'm working, too,
A:	so everything keeps me pretty busy.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But,
B:	I'm going to U T D here in Dallas.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	My dad taught there for a while,
B:	Oh, really?
A:	yeah.
B:	What did he teach?
A:	Uh, speech pathology.
B:	Oh, that's what I'm majoring in.
B:	I'm a graduate student in speech.
A:	Oh, wow!
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	No way.
A:	How long have you been there?
B:	Uh, this is my first semester.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	so you wouldn't know him.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Who, Who, who, who, what, when did he teach?
A:	He, Uh, he taught about a year ago.
A:	He used to work at, uh, uh, University of Texas at
A:	what,
A:	no,
A:	uh, oh, shoot,
A:	I can't remember what it's even called now,
A:	but, uh, he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time U T D at night.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, and then they stopped funding the program there. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so now he's at Texas Women's University.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, is he teaching speech pathology there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	what's his name?
A:	Allen Bird.
B:	Bird?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	B I R D?
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he published a paper, uh, couple of years ago, I think, didn't he, well, one that I read.
B:	Does he publish a little, quite a bit?
A:	Uh, somewhat
A:	and he has, he has some like different programs out,
A:	like I don't know what they're called,
A:	but they're like,
A:	and he has like little stuffed animals with them and like little cards and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	he has a test, he has a testing, yeah,
B:	a testing battery.
B:	He uses real,
B:	yeah,
A:	Right.
B:	I I remember.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that's interesting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, what are you studying?
A:	Uh, I was, I am studying nursing
A:	but I'm thinking about changing right now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just, I don't know,
A:	and it's really tough to get into the program down here
A:	so if I don't do that, if I decide to stay in nursing I'll probably come and go to T W U.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm living in the T W U dorm across from Collier, uh,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah
B:	and, uh,
A:	My dad used to teach at Collier, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's, that's where the speech program is. Uh,
B:	I'm living in that dorm
B:	and there, all those nursing majors.
B:	I, I tell you what,
B:	that's, that's a tough, that's a tough, uh, field, though.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Nursing is.
B:	I, I have a lot of respect for those people.
B:	I mean, they've spent a lot of hours studying
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, you're at Baylor?
A:	No,
A:	I'm at B Y U, in Utah
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Brigham Young.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I see,
B:	all right.
A:	So, but, I get to come home at, on the nineteenth
A:	and I'm so excited
B:	Oh, really?
A:	I'm so homesick.
B:	Do you like
B:	it's in Salt Lake City, right?
A:	It's in Provo actually.
B:	Oh, is it?
A:	But yeah,
A:	I really, I really like it out here.
B:	Do you?
A:	But, I've been, I, I've been away too long.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm from Colorado,
B:	so I, I've been away from there too long
A:	Uh, how, how,
A:	Okay,
A:	all set.
B:	Good morning
A:	Good morning.
A:	Let's see,
A:	music, um,
A:	well, I play a couple of instruments.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I try to.
B:	What do you play?
A:	Um, clarinet is my primary instrument,
A:	and I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Really,
B:	that's too bad
A:	How about yourself?
B:	I play, uh, the violin and play trumpet
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh.
B:	and I run a municipal band
B:	and I sometimes conduct.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	So, I'm pretty busy too.
B:	I play in three different symphony orchestras.
A:	Wow.
B:	We have a nice big one here in State College, called the Nitny Valley Symphony.
A:	That's great.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I play in the Altoona Symphony,
B:	was about forty-five miles away
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven Symphony and Community Orchestra.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So are you a professional musician?
B:	No,
B:	I'm, uh, just retiring from Penn State University
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	only I, I should, should have been.
B:	I spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I've been working at, uh, Penn State and using up all my nighttimes, and weekends uh, going to these orchestra rehearsals and, and concerts and so forth.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I understand,
A:	yeah.
A:	I'm in one community band here,
A:	and that's just,
A:	well, we rehearse once a week.
A:	We generally have a concert every other week
A:	and,
B:	You have one that often.
A:	Yeah
B:	That's amazing because I, I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert.
A:	That's a lot.
A:	No,
A:	we sure don't.
B:	Wow.
A:	Well, one thing is, we have a summer summer series,
A:	and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little out, outdoor stage set up
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer,
B:	You are busy.
A:	yeah,
A:	and then, I don't know. We just have an awful lot of engagements,
A:	and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, um, because, you know, uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.
B:	Where do you get all this music,
B:	I mean, you, you must back up and play some of the music twice.
A:	Oh yes,
A:	definitely, we really do.
A:	You know, you get your little Sousa book
A:	and you just flip through it, and that sort of thing.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	So your, you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then.
A:	It really depends on who shows up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and it's always a mystery,
A:	because it actually doesn't matter who shows up,
A:	it matters what instruments they brought,
A:	because so many people switch instruments so often.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, yeah,
A:	in the winter we do more concert stuff
A:	and,
B:	How many people in your band?
A:	Um, I think there's about seventy.
B:	Seventy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's a lot.
B:	Holy mackerel,
B:	that's.
A:	But, on any given night there's not seventy you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it alternates quite a lot.
B:	Boy,
B:	that is a huge organization,
B:	that's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it really is.
B:	Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty in, in the band I have here.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well.
B:	But that fills a stage and keeps us busy,
B:	but they were, half have been professionals from, uh, a lot of them are from, uh, faculty at Penn State here.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And so they want to play things that, uh, push them to do.
B:	So that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the last one we did was in a large, uh, mall close here,
B:	we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So that worked out very nicely.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's fun.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, let's see.
A:	Well, there's another band around here.
A:	Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and their concert schedule isn't as heavy,
A:	but they have more in the summer,
A:	I think they have ten in the summer, you know, one, one week after the other.
A:	I think they're like Monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period.
B:	Wow,
B:	that.
B:	Are you just saying you, you sight read every concert?
A:	Uh, well, it's not really sight reading when you've done it, you know, again and again and again,
A:	but some people are,
B:	Okay.
A:	yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	some of them are.
B:	And where, where does this happen, Laurie,
B:	is this in Dallas?
A:	Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We're real close to Dallas.
B:	Well, I declare.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's amazing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else, you know.
B:	Okay.
A:	And, and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so
B:	Okay.
A:	and, That's probably why we get so many people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do any of your, you, in your group get paid for any of this?
A:	Um, well, the conductor gets paid a little bit, you know,
A:	we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I think he's the only one that gets paid.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you do have to buy your music.
B:	Who, who sponsors you basically, the city?
A:	The city,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, uh,
B:	my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a similar thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I can't remember what they call it,
A:	but the same type of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but we do get an awful lot of music, you know,
A:	we can borrow music from any of the area colleges
B:	Yes.
A:	or, you know, if some, some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we do an awful lot of, you know,
A:	we don't charge for any of our performances,
A:	but we get a lot of donations.
B:	Well, I, I work the same way
A:	Yeah
B:	Well, I'll be darned.
B:	It's amazing.
A:	Hi.
B:	Well, what do you think?
A:	Well, providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task
A:	and I, uh, personally, I don't approve of it for two reasons.
A:	Number one is that I think that, uh, the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now,
A:	and if they were to administer this, they would, uh, get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out ourselves.
A:	Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would, would be dried up
A:	and really no one would be, would only answer to, to the government to a big bureaucratic mess.
A:	And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries
A:	and so I don't think, uh, I don't think we should head in that direction.
A:	Although that we have problems right now
A:	and I do agree that they exist
A:	because health care insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing
A:	and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How do you feel about the whole ordeal?
B:	Well, I agree that it's a big task,
B:	but I think that, I think that the U S should move toward some kind of national health care plan. At least as a long term kind of goal.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And possibly, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing,
B:	but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea to, uh,
B:	and not have a completely socialized, medical system in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	It, uh, just because it seems that, uh, health insurance costs are sky rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit perhaps
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and so that,
B:	and  that's a   that's a vicious cycle, of course.
A:	But what,
A:	What you're  Yeah,
A:	so what you're  saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh, government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child with, throughout the whole company, you see more of them as regulating the high costs, uh, that people are forced to pay for it right now.
B:	Because,
A:	Is that is that correct,
B:	Um,
A:	or do you think that,
B:	Well, I, uh, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately.
B:	I don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea.
B:	And, uh
A:	Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the government, uh,
A:	because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more taxes
A:	and the, the the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to, to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now the, the public themselves get health insurance
B:	Right.
A:	and they provide their own health insurance.
B:	The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance
B:	and so that the other people have no health insurance
B:	and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies
B:	and somebody winds up paying for that
B:	and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance
B:	so I don't see that anything, that this situation would get any worse.
B:	That way it might get better.
A:	You think it might get better, huh?
A:	I, I kind of disagree
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The reason being is, uh, we have,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I guess it's my, my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, the, the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and, and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business, whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business.
A:	People would still have to pay taxes,
A:	the money would have to come from somewhere
A:	and so you'd
A:	I, I feel that the cost would increase dramatically also.
A:	But in the same sense the, the care and the, the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical, uh, field would, would diminish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I think,
A:	Okay
B:	Yes.
A:	First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing .
A:	Um, I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly.
A:	I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it.
A:	It doesn't seem like,
A:	but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's kind of dangerous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't know.
B:	We live, um, well, I'm close to Salt Lake
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there's mountains, uh, you know, all around.
B:	But sometimes I think tend to hold a little bit of it in, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Really, it's, it's fairly clean, um,
B:	I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some,
B:	but, you know how quite a,
A:	But you think the mountains and the, are kind of a barrier?
B:	Yeah
A:	Oh .
B:	I think sometimes it seems to be
B:	but, But, uh, anyway, I don't know.
A:	That's an interesting thought.
B:	I know there's a lot of plants here,
B:	when I drive down you know, along the, just along the freeway, there's a lot of plants that they're burning things
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	Here in Texas I know a lot of the, pretty much every place here is relatively flat,
A:	and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a, like a smog problem or something like that.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We, we have a real fog problem. Um.
A:	Um.
B:	The last few years just in, through December and January it, it really is foggy and, and seems to just, um,
B:	it's kind of like it, it just stays for a month quite foggy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, gee,
B:	I don't, I don't know what else.
A:	I
B:	I know cars
A:	I
A:	yeah,
A:	I guess I've never really, uh, thought about the fact, like in California they, they have a lot of smog problems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's real hilly there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So that is probably something that plays a big factor.
A:	I think probably just, uh, a lot of factories, um, you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's what I see burning a lot.
B:	I'm not exactly sure what they're burning.
B:	I know, uh-huh, there are some oil companies,
B:	and I'm sure that that contributes a lot
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	just the burning of the
A:	Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, uh, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
B:	I haven't, I haven't heard that.
A:	Um.
B:	I know, uh,
B:	I don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything,
B:	but I know I think they, they differ from state to state.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	But, um, you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others.
B:	I think those, uh,
B:	what are they,
B:	the,
B:	I know,
B:	a Rabbit's one, diesel
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	the diesel.
B:	the diesel cars.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they seem to put out quite a bit
A:	I know a lot of people with diesels
B:	Huh.
A:	truck, you know.
B:	Oh.
A:	But, um.
B:	Well, do you, um, are you working for T I?
A:	No,
A:	I don't.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I, I work in Waco at a T V station.
B:	Oh.
A:	My mother works at T I.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	That's why,
B:	And that's how you got involved.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You work at T I?
B:	No
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	we, we have, um,
B:	my husband's sister lives in Dallas actually.
A:	Okay.
B:	And they kind of got it, us involved that way.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah
A:	That's interesting.
B:	but. Well, I don't, I don't know.
A:	What else causes air pollution? Um,
A:	Noise.
B:	Yeah,
B:	noise.
A:	Noise causes air pollution
B:	I've got,
B:	speaking of noise, you can probably hear my little.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's why I thought of it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he is quite noisy.
B:	Yes,
B:	gee,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I know that, um,
B:	don't dumps, you know, where you dump all your trash in the, uh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Landfills.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm sure that does.
B:	I know they're always churning that up
A:	We just.
B:	and I, I think they burn a lot there, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We just had a big, uh, thing here in Waco.
A:	They're needing to open a new landfill, or to expand onto the old landfill.
A:	And, uh, it's, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so they,
B:	Well, I don't think I'd, I'd like that.
B:	You know, we, um
A:	Yeah.
B:	when we've taken things to the dump, just the dump, uh, that is, uh, you know, closest to us,
B:	there's some houses around there,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I know that on windy days, you know they're always moving the, the trash over to different spots,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and they've got those big bulldozers,
B:	and you can see the dust flying,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and I'm sure that their homes are really quite  dusty
A:	One  one of the big concerns is they have a, there's a school right across the highway from the landfill.
B:	and,
B:	Oh, is there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So the parents were really, really upset.
B:	Worried about their their kids getting, huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They, they've been fighting over it for the last year,
A:	and they just now approved it.
A:	So they're going to try an appeal or something.
A:	We could talk about my favorite subject
B:	Cooking and food, huh.
A:	Food
B:	What do you like to cook?
A:	Uh, I don't cook a lot actually.
A:	I have just started baking,
A:	so, uh, I am kind of interested in cakes and, uh, muffins and stuff like that,
A:	but I can't seem to get them exactly right.
A:	So, I am just trying to perfect some things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I tried to make an applesauce cake. Which I will never ever try to make again.
A:	It was horrible
B:	Oh dear.
A:	I don't know if the cake was horrible or if I made it horrible.
B:	Oh, probably not.
B:	I, uh, have, uh, a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like. That, uh, doesn't require kneading the dough.
A:	Uh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Hey
B:	And, it is always, it is wonderful.
B:	It is,
B:	and what is funny is that you use, uh, bran, all bran
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it looks like it is a wheat bread.
A:	Uh.
B:	But, it is actually all bran flour
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know, it is just regular
B:	the type that, you know, yeast and that sort of thing
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you let it rise
B:	and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down, and then, uh, make your rolls.
B:	They really are good
A:	Wow.
B:	and they are so easy to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That is
B:	seems like every time that we have a dinner party, or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before.  They always ask me to, bring those rolls
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They request it.
A:	I have not gotten any requests yet.
A:	Last year, I had a Christmas party, at, uh, my office,
A:	and I, uh, made the tuna fish sandwiches.
A:	And everyone, uh, I mean, I think, everyone knows how to make tuna fish,
A:	so I thought that would be easy for me to make
A:	and I can not go wrong with that,
A:	and so I made it
A:	and, uh, I used celery seed in my,
A:	Do you use celery seed in your tuna fish?
B:	No
B:	I haven't.
A:	And I just thought it was so strange,
A:	because I never, I thought that that was what celery seed was for.
A:	Was for tuna fish.
B:	Oh, how funny.
A:	And so, but everyone really, really loved the tuna fish
A:	and they just couldn't get over the fact that I used celery in it
A:	and it just surprised me.
A:	Celery and onion and,
B:	Well, see I, I have always used celery, I mean, I have used celery before.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I never used the celery seed in it.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, what else do you put in it besides the celery seed.
A:	Just like, uh, really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed
A:	and I use like, uh, Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But if you use salad dressing with kind of, uh, you know, kind of, I guess a tart taste. Then it comes out real good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I, uh, it was the first time I have I have ever found out that the, the, nobody else used celery seed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, having been there not too long ago, and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate, I'm fairly full of it, of it myself.
A:	Um.
B:	Uh, the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school, is that, you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized.
B:	I went through a number of them, uh, undergraduate schools, before I found a, a good school that was more general, uh, to give me time to make up my mind.
A:	Um.
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	I went to a, a liberal arts school, actually, at first,
A:	and you weren't really even, um, they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year,
A:	and then you, you know, you had, I think you had to pick it, by, by, by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major,
A:	but until then they didn't sort of force you.
A:	They, they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then. Certain requirements,
A:	so that, so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything,
A:	so it wasn't that specialized.
A:	So that,
B:	That's wonderful.
B:	I'm a great proponent of liberal arts education, for anybody.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, being an engineer now, I believe in it even more strongly than I did before.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was just on a committee recently, actually sponsored by, uh, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, trying to sort of, you know, where, where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together, you know, because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts,
A:	and then the other way around as well,
A:	people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.
A:	So,
B:	Well, thus far it's working to my advantage.
B:	Uh, the great gap historically has, with engineers, has been while they may have all this technical information, they have no way of imparting it to, except to another engineer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand.
A:	Well, that must be helpful.
B:	Well, it's,  a lot of fun, at the moment.
A:	That could be very helpful .
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I figure that, that, that's probably the thing I would most tell any parent, you know, to tell their kids, I think, probably
A:	make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education
A:	and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure they want, early on they want to do something like engineering or something.
A:	Or they can,
B:	Even at that, I have a son, that, who's only nine at the moment.
B:	But I see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality,
B:	and, uh, if he decides to pursue that, I'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college, before I'll even let him go to an engineering college.
A:	Um.
B:	And, yes,
B:	that'll add one year to his education experience.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, but that's a good idea.
A:	Well, where I am right now,
A:	actually I'm at the University of Rochester,
A:	and that's a pretty good engineering school, I think.
A:	I think we do some  they have pretty good engineering here.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
A:	They also have a fairly large liberal arts college as well. A sort of, a separate, you know, arts and sciences college.
A:	Um, and I believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in, in everything,
A:	and I know people, I do, uh, I do work in language processing,
A:	and, and, and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer, started off as an an electrical engineer student, and then switched over at some point into language processing, because he found that he enjoyed it more.
A:	So they do force them,
A:	people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.
B:	Oh, I agree.
B:	Uh, I have the experience, uh,
B:	the last school that I went to was Mississippi State University which is historically an engineering and agricultural school.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, the typical land grant university,
B:	every state's got one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Anyway, while it has both engineering and liberal arts, the engineering students tend to cluster together.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the engineering department.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they don't learn the communications,
B:	they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of, of endeavor.
A:	Um.
B:	It's, you know, it, that's kind of like if I were king for a day, and got to, and got to make one rule. My rule would be, no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy.
A:	Um, uh-huh.
A:	That would,  be very good actually.
B:	And it's,  that's not even true in our colleges.
A:	Right,
A:	you, you don't need any philosophy at all in school.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or
A:	yeah,
A:	or, or, or, or some other thought provoking area, you know.
A:	Very true.
A:	We had, uh, when I went to undergraduate, we had uh,
A:	went to Brandeis,
A:	don't know if you know of it or not, uh,
A:	we had, uh, uh, a requirement freshman year of just Humanities.
A:	Then you were given a choice of, um, you know,
A:	there were ten or twelve, or whatever, or fifteen different courses that you could take,
A:	but they all centered, they all came out of Philosophy, English, and Literature departments,
A:	and they were, they were, they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read, you know for,
A:	so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad an, and so forth,
B:	Right.
A:	and what they did do, was they all approached it from, from very different,
A:	so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something, that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this, or, um, one literature, you know, or a, a literature course or, just all sorts of different perspectives on it,
A:	and people got to pick and choose,
A:	but, but by the end, everyone had a good sample of, of, of, sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically, you know,
A:	and, uh, and that sort of forced them.
A:	But I believe that, that, that you, one of the, one of the best things to do, at least for me in school was, was, I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.
A:	Um, I was forced to take, I think you know, some sort of art history course,
A:	and we all grumbled about it at first,
A:	but then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like something, something we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing,  and something I would never would have done if, if I wasn't forced to take it.
B:	Yes, I  I remember that experience
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that and, uh, extra music classes.
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that, and that really is something that, that I notice,
A:	like I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized,
A:	and they don't have that.
A:	They just, you know, they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take,
A:	and that was all.
A:	They never had some of the more fun classes, I guess .
A:	I feel a little more worldly now
B:	Well, that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school.
A:	Yes,
A:	I'm, I'm, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.
B:	Have, have you gone straight through?
A:	Yes,
A:	I, I graduated, um, college in eighty-seven,
A:	and I just went straight through.
A:	Um, I'm finishing up next year.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	I didn't take any break or anything yet.
A:	I've been trying actually, in graduate school, I've been trying to do the same thing, take courses, completely outside my area,
A:	and I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder, because, uh, I just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course, that I'm not getting graded for.
A:	Whereas before I would just sign up for credit for it, now I can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily.
A:	So I have to try and go myself,
A:	and I went for like two or three weeks and realized, not enough time for the work unfortunately.
B:	That's true.
B:	Are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate?
A:	I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology.
A:	So, I'm just, wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead.
A:	Uh, what else.
A:	I, I think I,
B:	Well, let me, let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way.
A:	Oh.
B:	I, I first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, six years, and a, and a war later, uh, I got a degree, an undergraduate degree.
B:	And then fifteen years after that, I got the first of a set of master's degrees
B:	and four years after that I got another master's degree.
A:	Um. You had real world experience in the middle there.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	And that helped, you think?
A:	Or that was,
B:	It, it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um. Yeah,
A:	I'm getting some of that.
A:	Um, I have, I have sort of some, work experience .
A:	My wife is not an academic at all.
A:	My wife is sort of in the real world,
A:	and so I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world
A:	and I, getting, you know, real world .
A:	Especially she works in, uh, uh, she works in the, she works for a temporary agency,
A:	and I never would have had,
A:	she's the office supervisor,
A:	I never would have had any, I've, I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her, and her business as well.
A:	So yeah,
A:	so I, I can, I can see where that might be a,
B:	Well, vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.
A:	Yeah
B:	It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,
B:	but experience is a wonderful, teacher also.
A:	That's my,
A:	oh yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	agreed,
A:	agreed.
A:	Well, I'll, I'll take that, I'll take that and think that through a little bit. Uh.
B:	My wife, as I may have mentioned, just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago.
A:	Yes.
B:	and she pursued her education along the lines that I did with lots of break in between.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now.
B:	She has an awful lot of experience to draw on.
B:	No longer
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.
A:	No,
A:	I don't,
B:	You don't?
A:	but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.
B:	My goodness.
B:	So. Well, I have two daughters
B:	and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,
B:	and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.
B:	Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask, or expect.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.
B:	Well, if I were
A:	Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.
A:	Yes,
A:	I would think someone older
A:	and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think that varies.
B:	I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's true also.
B:	Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified per se.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.
A:	I'm twenty-two now
A:	and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.
A:	But, um, the only thing people ever asked me,
A:	well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,
A:	but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.
A:	The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.
B:	Oh, uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.
B:	Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up
B:	and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,
B:	I know I did this with my children,
B:	it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself
B:	so they, they thought, okay,
B:	she knows how to, how to treat children.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, see when, um, I first got my my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.
A:	Um, this lady saw us at church
A:	and she was a you know, she was a younger lady.
A:	She didn't really know my mom.
A:	She knew my mom by name
A:	and that was it.
A:	And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family
A:	so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,
A:	I thought that was pretty strange.
A:	You know, and she had two children.
A:	One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.
A:	So, I you know, I enjoy kids
A:	and I get along with them very well
A:	so there's no problem.
A:	But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.
B:	Oh, I agree with you,
B:	but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's true.
B:	and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So she was going on those two instincts.
B:	Just the same I know myself,
B:	I never,
B:	and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.
A:	Oh, I would be too
B:	And, and in it really shocked me
B:	because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.
B:	She had just moved in the neighborhood.
B:	She had her daughter with her,
B:	and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.
B:	And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I mean people are so different.
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	Um, well, I I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.
B:	Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I worked just a part-time job
B:	and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in
B:	and, you know, I made a few phone calls,
B:	I went in and visited.
B:	I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, that was a concern with me.
B:	Um, you know, you, you learn a lot by going in there
B:	and they they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,
B:	and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.
B:	You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know, that have done this over and over again.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well,
B:	But I,
B:	go ahead.
A:	How did you stumble upon the day-care center?
A:	Did you just look it up in a phone book
A:	or what was it?
B:	Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think most people do that.
B:	I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything
B:	or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world
A:	Yes,
A:	exactly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So there, there are just so many considerations.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?
B:	Oh, money is always a factor in my life, definitely.
B:	I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.
B:	I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,
B:	but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.
A:	Yes.
B:	So, and, and then when you get, you know, when you get into the full-time basis day care,
A:	Good morning.
B:	Hi.
A:	My name is Jean.
B:	I'm Tina.
A:	Oh, where you from Tina?
B:	I live in Garland, Texas.
A:	Oh, Garland, Texas,
A:	I'm in Pennsylvania.
B:	Oh, my lands, you're the farthest person I've ever talked to.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you work for Texas Instruments?
B:	My husband does.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Probably most people you talk to do, huh?
A:	Most of them do.
A:	Now, I don't have anybody that works for T I,
A:	but, uh my son works for a computer company, the National Institute of something,
B:	Huh.
A:	I don't know what
B:	I see,
B:	well that's neat.
A:	So, I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess you have to push one, though.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
A:	You ready?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess so,
B:	it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	my brother lives down East of us down there,
A:	and I don't think they ate all that much different
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods,
A:	course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	Uh.
B:	Well, uh, the thing that I found interesting,
B:	my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's not as good as if it's fresh.
B:	Right,
B:	and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like Mexican foods,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could,
B:	but it just, didn't taste right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like chicken fried steak, is a real big thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Up there, uh, it was hardly ever heard of
B:	and, we drink ice tea with every meal,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea
A:	Yeah,
A:	well they do in the summertime,
A:	I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly.
B:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.
B:	Right.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it never gets real cold.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but when, when we have a dinner party around here, I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know that, um, I do a lot of planning with our church,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a Mexican dish
B:	or. And Italian food is real big too.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	More like covered dishes for those type of dinners.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	How about you,
B:	what is real popular up there?
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	just about anything
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we really, uh, use most anything.
A:	I, uh, I think like parties and that though are,
A:	well, like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party
B:	Oh.
A:	But, basically, we tried, you know, included all the basic, uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Your, uh, bread family and your,
A:	or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and , ham and bake potatoes, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,
A:	you know they been advertising that
A:	and, we've really been enjoying those, uh, meals.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	They have a lot of vegetable to them,
A:	and, uh, they really are very good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	I, I love that kind of cooking.
B:	My, uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things
A:	Is he a meat and potato person?
B:	Right.
B:	They.
A:	Well, all our family is, is gone.
A:	They are out on their own.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh. It, it's much different
B:	That probably makes it easier,
B:	but.
A:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese
B:	and, uh, and of course ,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, my husband didn't like that,
A:	so we, us kids,
A:	we had five children
A:	and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,
B:	Right.
A:	that's what we had
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that's pretty much what we do,
B:	if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese, or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, they like, uh, spaghetti.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, that's one meal, I can fix
A:	Uh, yeah.
B:	and the whole family eats.
B:	But, uh, there are several things that,
B:	well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because.
A:	Oh, those always go good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the children love them,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, they are real easy to cook
B:	and, that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, well,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and my girls don't like beef,
B:	I, don't know,
A:	Oh really.
A:	Well maybe. that's good the way, way the things are going.
B:	I guess,
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	it could be, they don't,
B:	I think it's the texture of it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it takes more chewing
A:	Right.
A:	Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it is easier to chew.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	So they're not too much into beef.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My husband and I eat more beef than we should,
B:	but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them
A:	Right.
A:	We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know if you do or not,
A:	but we, we don't a whole lot,
A:	we're more, once in a while, but mostly family, activities.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have a real tiny little house,
B:	we don't have room really, to have people here.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, we do get together for fellowships at our church,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And,
A:	Well that's good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is
B:	and it's fun to, uh,
B:	I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we do a lot of that take , things to church
B:	Yeah.
A:	and our homemakers meet at the church also,
A:	and, uh, that's what we do mostly, most of the time for that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you don't really include any certain food groups,
A:	you just bring, what you like
B:	Right.
B:	That's right
A:	Sometimes you have all desserts,
A:	sometimes, you have all vegetables
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever, you, uh, like best.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, it doesn't happen very often,
A:	usually you get a pretty wide variety
A:	and you can, you can , have pretty good meals, from one of those.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I remember one time we had a progressive dinner.
A:	Oh, those are fun.
B:	It's the only time that ever.
B:	Yeah
B:	they are.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's the only time I can remember that,
B:	I can't remember what food it was
B:	I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.
B:	Several people were supposed to bring, you know, each, like, uh, a, an appetizer, and a main dish and a dessert.
A:	Uh, uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
B:	and, but when we came to the main, main dish plate, there was only like two or three
A:	Oh, uh-huh
A:	, Oh.
A:	Was there enough to go around?
B:	Well, not really,
B:	you know we all took real tiny little portions, and, uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we were not sure who didn't show up with the food
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually
B:	Yes.
A:	and you know they know better.
B:	Right.
A:	Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .
B:	Right.
B:	Either, either go ahead and fix your dish
B:	or call someone that can.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	I know it.
B:	Well, that sounds neat,
B:	I can't, uh, believe you're so far away,
B:	but you sound so close.
A:	They said that we could share, we share, a recipe
B:	It sounds like you're here in Dallas.
A:	but, I'm up at my daughter's,
A:	I don't even have any of my recipes with me.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, you know ,
B:	I don't know if I have anything handy,
B:	we were just about, we were getting ready to go swimming,
A:	Oh.
B:	and we're waiting on my sister.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	Cara, hold on just a second another person in the
B:	As a matter of fact, my, little one is hollering
A:	They are ready to go.
A:	Well, we probably, have we talked long enough
A:	I,
B:	I think it probably has been.
A:	Okay,
A:	so I'll let,
B:	So, I've enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Oh, same here.
A:	You have a good day.
B:	Thank you.
B:	Thanks for calling.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, well, let's see.
B:	How many,
B:	you said yours are all,
B:	I mean, that sounds like an army.
A:	Five.
B:	Oh, lord.
B:	That is an army,
B:	I came from a family of six,
B:	and I have only got two,
B:	and they are, one ...
A:	Well any number is nice, let me tell you.
B:	Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not parenting,
B:	that's a hobby.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think.
B:	Well, do not tell that to all my friends.
B:	They are into quality time.
A:	Oh.
B:	I am into getting through the day.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too.
B:	sounds as if speaker B is washing Well I, I, I can spot a kid who really, you know, whose parents spend every, quality time with them, you know, outside of the work day.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And when I take care of some people's kids, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	when they, when they have teachers' holidays, and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids, that are usually in day care,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you can spot them, because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around.
A:	You can tell.
A:	How to just entertain themselves.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Really.
A:	It's a problem for any child
A:	and you take one that's used to being, uh, busy being, having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.
B:	It's not a problem for my two,
B:	they are only eighteen months apart
A:	uh, keeps you busy.
B:	They can find things to do and mess around, and plot and scheme and everything else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's great.
B:	You, did all five of yours complete college?
A:	No,
A:	our last daughter, she did not want to go to school.
A:	She's, uh, but she's married now,
A:	they built a home just a couple miles from us.
A:	And,
B:	Well, how did you go about selecting a college, then?
A:	Well, we did not do it right all the time
A:	With our first boy, we persuaded him to start here,
A:	and I do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home.
A:	I think the main thing is to, uh, right now, I think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in. Uh, and take what they are interested in,
A:	and then, then start looking for schools.
B:	Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at.
A:	No,
A:	not necessarily.
A:	But, Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have.
A:	He wanted to go to Embrey Riddle
A:	and we talked him into going local here first.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh.
A:	He went to aeronautical, uh, oh, just learning to work on engines and that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole life is
A:	And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally.
A:	And he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing.
A:	Uh, but, but right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut
A:	and they build and rebuild non jet engines.
B:	How about the other four, other three who went?
A:	Uh, the other ones, uh, the second one, she chose, we let her go where she wanted to, uh,
A:	we did not want her to go,
A:	but she went to Erie, to Gannan University. Uh, or Gannan College,
A:	I am not sure which it is,
A:	college, I guess.
A:	Uh, she went there two years
A:	and it was more expensive
A:	and she soon realized, you know,
A:	even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and finished at Clarion. Because, it, uh, saved her quite a bit of money
A:	and she got really the same basic education that she wanted.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And our other two boys, they went to Clarion also. And, uh, did very well there.
A:	And they have all really got, uh, they have all really got really good jobs.
A:	And, uh,
B:	When they were, like in junior high and high school, I mean, had they, did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	they kind of had that,
A:	they just expected to go.
A:	Daphne never went,
A:	she always said she would never go to college.
A:	She said, I, I always thought she would change her mind, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but she did not.
A:	And there's nothing wrong with that, you know, if,
A:	college is not for everybody.
B:	Uh.
A:	But, uh, it, it does make a difference in your wage income.
A:	I think it's what they want out of life,
A:	because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, you know, a much better income.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state.
A:	You know, that boggles,  my mind.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was,  I was making more than, I was making three times what my father was making, as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	did you go to college?
B:	Yeah,
A:	You did.
A:	See it makes a difference.
B:	I went, uh, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln, because Lincoln is where, where my parents live.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there really, there really was not a choice,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean the finances, uh, dictated that you had to go there.
A:	Uh. Uh-huh.
B:	I kind of,
B:	I am not going to say I resent it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I was, well you know, one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids, and the whole bit, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state, or anyplace else,
A:	Some place else.
B:	and I just knew that the finances, you know, would not support it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If I had known how, not, I am not going to say easy, but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, uh, scholarship, to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, you know, have gone
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that was, uh, I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened,
B:	I mean I was, taken out of my element, you know, the homogeny midwest, which is a lovely place to grow up, and put into someplace else where, people thought differently, looked differently, sounded differently, you know, different life style.
A:	That's great.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Different life styles,
A:	yes,
A:	yes.
B:	And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now my kids, I keep saying that, uh, you know, I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I do not know, you know, what the realities, you know, is going to look like, you know,
B:	we are putting money away already.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where, in addition to, you know, them getting an education, they really need a, you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, It's very different.
A:	Right.
A:	It's quite a bit different.
A:	See that's the way we are,
A:	we are more of a rural type of an area
A:	and it does make a difference.
A:	I, they say, you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking.
B:	You should not.
A:	Yeah,
A:	not really.
A:	Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help, with a more expensive college.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are better off.
A:	Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, we, we did all we could,
A:	but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go.
A:	They suggested some sort of a recipe, uh, for, uh, company, for entertaining.
A:	Did you have anything in mind that, uh, you'd like to share?
B:	Well, I, uh, just had a Christmas Around The World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres.
A:	Ooh.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I fixed, uh, a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy.
A:	Ooh, that sounds good.
A:	What,
B:	It's, uh, it's like, uh, eight ounces of cream cheese softened,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate.
B:	And,
A:	One tablespoon of worcester?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	And then you take and, uh, cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers.
A:	Oh, that,
B:	And that always goes over real well
B:	and it's real easy.
A:	How much chili sauce did you say?
B:	It's one of the small bottles.
A:	Like eight,
B:	I don't think, uh,
A:	Not eight ounces.
A:	That would be a lot.
B:	Well, it's about eight ounces.
A:	Is it?
B:	It, it,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	this would make a lot, right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it would probably make,
B:	well, it doesn't make quite as much as you think,
B:	but, yeah,
B:	spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin.
A:	And how much crab meat did you use?
B:	One tin. Of the flake.
A:	One, One can of flake.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And drain it real good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Have you ever used the, uh, imitation, yet?
B:	Yes,
B:	I have.
B:	I used it, uh, last Christmastime.
B:	Uh, what did I put it in?
B:	I think I just served it by itself.
B:	There's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff.
A:	Ooh, that sounds,
A:	I've tried it
A:	and then I have it here on hand for about a week
A:	and then all of a sudden it dawned on me,
A:	wait, is this totally imitation
A:	and then I found out,
A:	I went back to the store
A:	and they said it is a fish product.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, you know once you buy it.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	I thought, so, you know, they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is.
B:	That's very true.
A:	You know.
B:	Very true.
B:	I had bought a cheesecake, uh,
B:	and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen, which I felt was real nice.
A:	Oh, that's a good idea.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Whose was that?
B:	It, uh, was, uh, Lawry's, I believe, or Lawler's.
B:	And I got it,
B:	do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up there?
B:	It's real,
A:	Uh, Sam's,
A:	right,
A:	right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay,
B:	that's where I picked it up.
B:	It comes out of Chicago
B:	and they're very good cheesecakes.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, that sounds good
B:	Yeah.
A:	because that's great.
A:	That must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Okay,
A:	I, I've,
B:	And they have, and they have the little papers between them.
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, hey, that sounds,
B:	And I think they're, what, about nine dollars and something.
A:	Right.
A:	And it's something good to have on hand, too.
A:	It's frozen in the first place, right?
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	So, you can, uh,
A:	it is frozen, isn't it?
B:	Yes,
B:	it is frozen.
A:	And then you can re freeze.
B:	And I thaw it
B:	and then you can re freeze it.
B:	And,
A:	Hey, that sounds great.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That
B:	It was, they're very good, very good.
B:	And that's the one thing that I hate to make is desserts.
A:	Oh, do you?
A:	And that's my favorite.
B:	Is it?
A:	And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it.
B:	Oh, I love to eat it,
B:	but I don't like to make it.
B:	It takes time
B:	and you have to rack your brain,
B:	and, time I don't have anymore
A:	That's the, that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It is.
A:	I, I said I can make it no time.
A:	It's trying to think,
A:	and then we just, uh, built a new home
A:	and I have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so no matter where they're at, your company can see you cooking. Which is funny.
B:	That's right.
B:	And your mess
A:	This, well, this is what everyone has said.
A:	They said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen.
A:	And I said, yes,
A:	I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality.
B:	Yeah
A:	But, uh, what I have learned in the, uh, ten months we've lived here, is it that when I entertain, I have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the, everything through, ready to serve. Because with the open area, you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess, like you said.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	That's, that's right.
A:	So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, you know, right out of the magazine.
B:	Well, I like to have mine all done anyway, because then I want to, I want to party, too.
B:	I don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something
A:	You're right.
B:	You know.
A:	And you know the funny thing is, now that I have a large kitchen with a big island and that, I still have people trying to come, you know,
A:	they'll come in the kitchen
A:	and I said, out,
A:	we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for guests.
B:	Correct
A:	You're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen
B:	Sounds,
A:	And it, it has worked out.
A:	But at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh, well enough that they know, you know, it's very much at home type situation.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples, again, that we've known a long time like you, they, uh, we all bring things
B:	and it sure makes it a whole lot easier. Anymore.
A:	Well, we even have a better one.
A:	Now we decided that we all meet, we have it worked,
A:	Okay.
B:	All right,
B:	well, I'm not a big exerciser,
B:	but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker.
A:	I am, too.
B:	Are you?
A:	Yes.
B:	I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and keep their arms up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't do that.
B:	I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby
B:	or, you know, and I have to do that at least once a day. If it, If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before.
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	I can't neglect that because of the baby either.
A:	And how old is your baby?
B:	She just, uh, well, she was premature,
B:	so she's about nine months now, though.
B:	times goes fast.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he lost sixty-two pounds
A:	and I lost twenty-one.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program
A:	and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We have a little path that we do. And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly.
A:	we try to get out, uh, every, every night.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he plays racquetball twice a week,
A:	but I'm not into that,
A:	so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.
B:	Well, I think that is just wonderful.
B:	Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children
B:	and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.
A:	Yes.
B:	You know. Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, oh, this is wonderful,
B:	let's go
A:	Right
A:	that's right.
A:	I know my kids are into sports
A:	and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
A:	so we will just go out after that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Now, does your husband usually go with you, then?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh, see, now that's really nice.
A:	Yes.
B:	Because mine's at meetings sometimes
B:	and, and he's not really into it
B:	so I have to,
A:	No
A:	my husband never was either until he lost the weight.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That was his decision.
A:	He had arthritis in his hips
A:	and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.
B:	I think that is so wonderful.
A:	So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.
A:	And our dog has lost a little weight.
A:	He walks every night, too
A:	So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes.
B:	I bet.
B:	I think that's really, really good.
B:	And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.
A:	Yes.
B:	It's not,
B:	like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there.
A:	Making time for it.
B:	But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ...
A:	Yes.
B:	You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me
B:	and sometimes they don't.
B:	And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come.
B:	So, uh, I like to have somebody come with me.
A:	I know,
A:	I do, too.
B:	Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area.
A:	Right.
B:	So it, it's not real dangerous,
B:	but still, I don't like to go alone.
A:	No.
B:	So
A:	I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, it's nice to have another person there,
A:	but ...
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know,
A:	Mostly, it's my husband
A:	and sometimes it's my kids.
B:	Well, I think that's great.
B:	I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do.
B:	I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me.
A:	Me, too.
A:	I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and it just wore me out.
A:	I would leave totally exhausted.
A:	I never lost any weight,
A:	and I got to the point I dreaded going in.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So walking seems to be a good solution for me
A:	and it doesn't cost anything
B:	Right
B:	right.
B:	And it gives me time to think.
B:	So I think, not only does it help my body,
B:	but I think it helps my mind too.
A:	Yes.
B:	So I like that.
A:	That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and ...
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	need something
B:	and,
A:	Yep.
B:	They can wait until you get back home.
A:	Yep.
B:	Well, I think that's great
B:	Well, that's what I do for
A:	Yep,
A:	that's all I do, too.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	how's the weather been in Plano?
B:	Basically about the same as what you've probably had.
A:	Yeah,
A:	this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I don't know about you,
A:	but I was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks,
A:	and I'm ready for it to come back.
B:	Oh, you like the rain, do you?
A:	Well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six,
A:	and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.
B:	Oh, are you?
B:	I don't care for that as much.
A:	You don't
B:	No.
A:	are you a summer person?
B:	I'm a summer person
A:	Are you?
B:	I like the heat.
A:	Well, I have a friend who's the same way,
A:	and anything below sixty, she's just not happy
A:	but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh,
A:	my husband's from Nebraska,
A:	and they have more of the four seasons.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I'm from Utah,
B:	so, I, I like, the four seasons
A:	Oh, you're used to that, too.
B:	I just don't like the cold.
A:	You don't like the cold.
A:	Well, I usually like it about sweater weather,
A:	and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It goes from hot,
A:	and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer,
A:	and then it's cold
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I wish it were several months of that.
B:	The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.
A:	Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh,
A:	some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains
A:	and you really didn't have anywhere to go,
A:	and it's sleeping time.
A:	But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either
B:	Well, we have several children that are in sports,
B:	and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, sure it does.
A:	That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.
B:	I like it better, I think.
A:	And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I did a walk last night,
A:	and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still.
A:	Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.
B:	The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity,
B:	that part I don't care about.
A:	Well, I agree, absolutely,
A:	and you know, it's all relative,
A:	because I was from West Texas,
A:	and it was very dry,
A:	and so I thought Dallas was awful,
A:	and I still think so,
A:	but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week,
A:	and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning.
A:	They had to get the squeejies and clean them off.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to.
A:	But I agree with you,
A:	the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Yes.
A:	I do not like the
B:	Well another reason,
B:	well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely.
B:	We have a little garden that we have
B:	and and so it really helps our garden,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way
B:	and they like rain,
B:	or, it seems they thrive when it rains,
B:	they just, really,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so too.
A:	I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it seems like here,
A:	I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while.
A:	It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,
B:	Well,
A:	I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.
B:	Well I like seventies I like seventies okay.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.
B:	Oh, I don't like nineties.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	You can give me seventies
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you can give me eighties
A:	Yeah,
A:	keep it there
B:	and I'm okay.
B:	But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that
A:	Yeah.
B:	I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.
A:	Well, I do, too,
A:	I do, too
A:	and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it.
A:	But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Static here.
B:	That's okay
B:	Um, I've, I've thought about that, too,
B:	and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here
A:	Yeah.
A:	We do too.
A:	I think a lot of people agree the same.
B:	It just really gets way,
B:	when it gets way too hot
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and we've been here for several years,
B:	and we've been here years when it's been hundreds
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	now there have been worse summers.
A:	In fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall,
B:	Years,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	everybody seems to be,
A:	you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting,
A:	and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold,
A:	and they'll say,
A:	well those are the ones that like the cold weather.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	He, he always did such a good job, I thought.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	he did,
A:	he did.
A:	It was it was really a shame.
B:	A good weather man,
A:	He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Anyway, um, I guess it's,
A:	It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
B:	That's okay,
B:	they say when you're done you're done,
A:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Okay.
B:	you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	You just say, Have a good day or whatever.
A:	Well good,
A:	well, then have a good day.
B:	You too.
A:	And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.
B:	You too.
B:	What is it about, nursing homes?
A:	well, about nursing homes, and, and older people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're just really close here.
A:	And his mother has bad health too
A:	and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work
A:	and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe.
A:	It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.
B:	Oh, it's very difficult
B:	I know.
A:	Uh, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot if anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not you know, unrealistic.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I, uh,
A:	some nights his mother calls me and says can your family,
A:	and just bring the kids in the family
A:	and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
B:	Yeah,
B:	how old is she?
A:	She's ninety-two.
B:	Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two
B:	and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
A:	Oh, I think that's wonderful.
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.
A:	Well,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes
B:	and so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I was just going to say.
B:	They're in Missouri
B:	and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um,
B:	And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
A:	Yes.
B:	So,
A:	Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily
A:	but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.
B:	Right.
A:	And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves.
A:	Um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's one very close to where my parents are
B:	but, uh, I think it would be nice
B:	but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
B:	So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era
B:	and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is
B:	and, but I think you'd have to really,
B:	they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
A:	Nursing homes.
B:	But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
A:	Visit.
B:	I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
A:	They don't go and see them.
A:	That's right.
B:	They never go to see them.
A:	That's right.
B:	I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even,
B:	maybe, maybe Christmas.
A:	You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have to say that.
B:	Right.
A:	But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
B:	Oh, I do too.
A:	Um,
B:	Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas
B:	so maybe we'll get it improved.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	I hope so.
B:	Anyway.
A:	You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, it's tough I'm sure.
A:	And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
B:	Oh.
B:	Right,
B:	that would be devastating I'm sure
B:	so.
A:	And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh,
A:	it's a very, very hard decision I think.
B:	It is a tough decision
B:	and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's right,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
B:	Right.
A:	Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there,
A:	but he needed the medical treatment
A:	and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that might be a partial solution, or something.
B:	Right.
A:	But, um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever,
B:	I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, anyway,
A:	Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines.
B:	We've covered a little bit
B:	and, uh, it's good to hear from you
B:	and,
A:	Good to hear from you.
B:	Have a good,
A:	Have a lovely day.
B:	Have a good
A:	Okay.
A:	Have you faced, uh, elderly care yet, uh, nursing home care for any of your parents?
B:	Unfortunately, yes.
B:	Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, uh, my three brothers and our wives
B:	and we were talking, uh,
B:	we had a review with the nursing home staff.
B:	My mother's in a nursing home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we had a review today
B:	and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like, like, uh making decisions on living wills and extended care, that type of thing,
A:	Yes.
B:	so, yes,
B:	I'm very familiar with it
B:	and it's not something that is, uh, you know,
B:	I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience.
B:	But I guess we all do.
A:	I think sooner or later, uh,
A:	both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes
A:	and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	And, uh-huh.
A:	And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.
B:	Right.
A:	What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes?
B:	Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.
A:	Yes
B:	Uh, we've, you know, we've looked around
B:	and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area
B:	And the one she is in now, uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like.
B:	But, again, it's no different than every one.
B:	And, you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, well, even not as much care.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	It's not that expensive, really.
A:	No,
A:	uh, there, well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, theirs both ran,
A:	oh, I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred
A:	and my mother's was two thousand.
A:	Then, this has been five years ago.
A:	And, uh uh, one of the things that, you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	when I started out with my mother-in-law, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they knew.
A:	And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did a little bit, they did better.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	You know, uh-huh.
A:	And, you know, a couple of times with my mother-in-law, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, you know, would have to rate,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, uh,
A:	we had my mother all set to go into one
A:	and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, I saw areas that they had not shown me
A:	and they did not come across as well as, you know, what they had originally shown me,
B:	Well, I'll be darned.
A:	so, uh, we did not put her in that one.
A:	We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, you know, was much, uh, better pleased with the situation.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you, you know, this is the whole point.
B:	You've got, you've got to shop them.
A:	Yes,
A:	you do.
B:	I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the fact that these people are they're up and around,
B:	but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's very, very,
A:	Does your mother have Alzheimer's?
B:	She,
B:	well, who knows.
B:	They call it, uh, dementia.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we don't know.
B:	I, I mean she does not know us anymore
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's, basically the same.
B:	And her health is not that bad.
B:	Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last,
B:	well, she had been in a retirement community
B:	and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children.
B:	Well she, we, we just did not have the capabilities to, to take care of her.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in,
B:	and she's been in the nursing home now for, oh, I would say about three months.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And,
A:	Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?
B:	I'm sorry?
A:	Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?
B:	She,
B:	no,
B:	as far as she knew, she was going to a hospital. And that she could, she could handle a hospital
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we says, you know, mom, if you, you know, if you get a, you get better, you've got to have the care, the doctor insisted on it, you know, if you get better that you could come out.
A:	Okay,
A:	what kind of car are you going to buy next?
B:	Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, uh, a nice, safe, small car,
B:	but, um, uh, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have another four door car that I drive to work,
B:	and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and, uh, wouldn't be, wouldn't cost much with gas.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's true,
A:	that's true.
B:	What, what are you looking at?
A:	Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while,
A:	but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you think, Oh, well, maybe, maybe I would like a new car.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	oh, yes.
A:	But, uh.
B:	Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the
A:	Right,
A:	they are.
A:	I sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Diamante.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	oh, yes.
A:	That is a pretty car.
B:	I'm, uh, I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's pretty, too.
B:	but um, I, uh, you know, the, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they get pretty expensive.
B:	Yes,
B:	they do.
A:	The last one I bought, I bought a, uh,
A:	well, it's a, it's a Town Car,
A:	but it was a demo, returned
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.
A:	So I was really pleased to find that,
A:	and I then, I bought it for cheaper,
A:	I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one
B:	Yes.
A:	and I bought this, uh, the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.
B:	Wow.
B:	Well, you get a much bigger, better comfortable ride.
A:	And the thing about it is they give you that ten, uh, that hundred thousand mile, five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired.
B:	Yes.
B:	Well, that's fantastic.
B:	That's real, real good.
A:	So, uh, I have really been impressed.
A:	I said, I probably never be able, to find another one that I can afford, you know.
B:	No,
B:	do you,
A:	But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there
A:	and you're not even tired.
B:	Very comfortable, smooth ride, huh.
A:	And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road.
B:	Oh, it does?
A:	It sure does.
B:	That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car.
A:	I, they kept telling me that,
A:	and I thought they're crazy,
A:	so the week after I got it, well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City
B:	Yes.
A:	and it did it.
B:	Wow.
B:	That's great.
A:	But it's, uh,
B:	That's great.
B:	That kind of gas mileage, uh, we're, we're kind of hoping for on our van.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do,
A:	and then we hope for it,
A:	and it never happens
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it really, it does get good gas mileage.
B:	Well, that's excellent.
A:	Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you, uh, do, does it, uh, need a lot of repairs?
B:	Is it a very reliable kind of car?
A:	I haven't had anything,
A:	I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things,
A:	and it cost me the twenty-five dollars.
A:	The, uh, really something really silly when we first got it,
A:	we couldn't get the light,
A:	they have all these lights in the car
B:	Yes.
A:	and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat
B:	Yes.
A:	and we couldn't get the light to turn off.
B:	Um.
A:	And we kept trying, you know,
A:	and we went out to dinner with some friends,
A:	and it stayed on all night, you know just shining right down on them, you know
B:	Oh dear.
B:	Oh dear
A:	and we couldn't get it to turn off,
A:	and the next day my husband goes out there
A:	and he tries to get it off,
A:	we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we turned everything we could,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he took it in,
A:	and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch.
A:	He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,
A:	and I can't get the light off,
A:	it's broken.
B:	Yes.
A:	So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars,
A:	and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,
A:	and they showed us where the switch was.
B:	They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, huh.
A:	They, they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	oh, so they probably went through the,
A:	But he hadn't, he hadn't done the right one.
B:	I see
A:	And it's right on the arm rest in the back
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we didn't know it was there.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
B:	And found it right away.
A:	and so we thought, you know, there, there was, it was broken.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But we've had just, uh,
A:	I guess it's been in two times.
A:	I've had it three years now.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh, it's been in two, maybe three times.
A:	But it's just been real minor things.
B:	Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then,
B:	and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair
A:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,
B:	so.
A:	That's right.
A:	But it's really, it's been an enjoyable car.
A:	Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know
B:	Yes
A:	and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.
B:	No,
B:	not at all.
A:	And they keep going up,
A:	so I'll have to enjoy it,
A:	Okay,
A:	we're on, uh, recycling
B:	Yes.
A:	and, uh, I am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know that we, uh, they ask us to bundle our newspapers,
A:	and we do that,
A:	and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff.
B:	I see.
A:	But now Plano has quite an elaborate system, don't they?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they do.
B:	Uh, it started out several years ago when they put these, uh, collection sites they, uh, near a WalMart, near a football stadium and the like,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up.
B:	These huge dumpsters were being filled up in a, in a matter of a week.
B:	So they knew that there was something going on here.
B:	So, they started looking into programs,
B:	and what we have now,
B:	it, they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week, they make a collection on Monday for yard waste,
B:	and the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's a pretty good size.
B:	It's maybe the size of two or three, um, grocery bags.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we put that out by the street,
B:	and they collect those on Monday.
B:	And then on Wednesday, we put out two containers that they gave us.
B:	One container's a huge, green, monstrous thing that a, uh, uh, a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck.
B:	So and that's where you put your regular, um, garbage and trash.
A:	Okay.
B:	And then also, that same day, you put out a small tub,
B:	it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide,
B:	and you put, just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper,
B:	and then the.
A:	Okay,
A:	and then they they separate it.
B:	Exactly,
B:	they have a big truck that has like not ten, maybe five big doors on the side of it,
B:	and they throw the different stuff in the different doors.
A:	Oh, that's a neat system.
B:	Yeah
B:	it is.
B:	And apparently it's, you know, it, it went off pretty much without a hitch.
B:	The trucks, the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	that the trucks were being, the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other.
B:	But it does work pretty well.
A:	Well, I know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano,
A:	and I know they have commented on the system.
A:	I don't know that they know that it worked that way,
A:	but they have the two separate containers and stuff.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I noticed something interesting last time, I guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up,
B:	I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the, that tub stuff,
B:	and the man who was doing the separating, when he was done emptying the tub, he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt
B:	and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub.
B:	So they must be collecting information about who does it, and how often.
A:	Oh, that is interesting.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because I wonder if that means that if you don't do it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	do you suppose they will come and knock on your door and,
B:	I, I don't know,
B:	but I think that's a really interesting question.
A:	That, that is interesting.
A:	You know, will you be penalized if you don't.
A:	Will you, uh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that seems farfetched only because it, it, there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So there, there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have.
A:	That's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, uh, cans, you know, from the, the market and, uh you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera.
B:	Right.
B:	No,
B:	they won't take vegetable cans.
A:	Oh, they don't take vegetable cans.
B:	Just, just the aluminum pop cans.
A:	This is just their aluminum cans.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, then yes,
A:	so they have,
A:	that's interesting.
A:	I wonder, uh, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	what they're doing with that.
A:	Wouldn't you really like to know?
B:	I would.
B:	Someday I'm sure we'll find out.
A:	I'm sure
A:	you know, if nothing else call the sanitation department say, okay,
A:	what are you doing reading you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So tell me your feelings on recycling.
B:	Is it, do you think this is a good thing, or silly.
A:	I think it's a very good thing.
A:	I think that, uh, I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it,
B:	Yes.
A:	and I can't say that my husband and I are real, real conscientious.
A:	We got started on the aluminum cans because our, uh, grandson was collecting them, uh, to raise money and stuff for an organization he was in.
B:	Yes.
A:	So we started collecting them,
A:	and now he's through,
A:	so we've just, we've kept on
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's interesting, too, that we have to drive, we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, uh, just inside your city limits, to, you know turn them in to dump them in.
B:	Dump them off.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and that is interesting.
A:	I'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson
B:	Right.
A:	but we just haven't really seen them advertised or you know, something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, the
B:	yeah,
B:	the Plano newspaper each, each day, in fact, has a, a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things.
B:	They publish it every single day.
A:	Well, that's interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and phone numbers, and, and that kind of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, I haven't noticed, uh, I haven't noticed Richardson, you know, making that big a,
A:	Okay
A:	on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why?
B:	Well, I guess I stand on, uh, on, probably ten for no, uh, restrictions.
B:	I, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska,
B:	and I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms,
B:	and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else,
B:	but, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food
A:	Yes,
A:	true.
B:	and, uh, I was raised, uh, you know, hunting all the time,
B:	I lived on the farm, and, uh, you know, enjoy hunting
B:	and I guess I have, uh, some problems with, uh, being restricted to, um, owning a gun for, you know, hunting purposes mainly.
A:	Right.
B:	And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can, I can understand that.
A:	I was raised in Oklahoma,
A:	and of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	the hunting and everything,
A:	and I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all,
A:	and I, I did, used to be all in favor of it,
A:	but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs.
A:	Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing.
A:	But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere,
B:	but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings
B:	and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all,
B:	and, uh.
A:	Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was.
A:	There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas,
A:	and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years,
A:	and of course it was definitely there.
A:	So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this.
A:	It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse.
A:	I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in.
A:	I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs.
A:	I don't know what the answer is.
A:	I know that it's scary,
A:	and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do,
A:	and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.
B:	I, I think so,
B:	and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one,
B:	and, uh, and then, uh.
A:	Well, it's very true.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun
A:	It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them.
A:	And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too.
A:	I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Because even if you said, okay,
A:	you know, armed forces could have them,
A:	some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh,
B:	and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.
A:	That's very true
A:	very true.
A:	Who knows,
A:	we maybe want to overthrow the government
B:	Well, the way things are going.
A:	I know,
A:	if somebody doesn't do something.
A:	Uh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?
B:	Well, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, uh, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much,
B:	and so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, I guess our topic is about movies
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, what is coincidence,
A:	we got a baby-sitter
A:	and we went to the movies that past weekend.
B:	Oh, so did I
A:	And we saw CAPE FEAR.
B:	Oh, I heard that was excellent.
A:	It is.
B:	Is it?
A:	It's really good.
B:	Uh, I wanted to see that
B:	I was deciding between that and, uh, MY GIRL
B:	and, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.
A:	Oh, how was that?
B:	Oh, it was excellent.
B:	It was a really, really good movie.
B:	I'd recommend it.
A:	I heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.
A:	Is that true?
B:	Uh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I don't know, though,
B:	I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me
B:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	because, uh, the little boy dies.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It was sad.
B:	It was really sad.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Maybe.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, it was really good.
B:	It was sad, very sad.
A:	Oh, I want to see that one.
A:	Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It was really suspenseful.
A:	So that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.
B:	I heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent,
B:	but it was kind of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.
A:	Uh, no,
A:	and it, uh, it was kind of,
A:	I don't know,
A:	it's kind of both, I guess,
A:	but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.
B:	Oh.
A:	And it, it was a real good movie.
A:	And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Because we have two kids. And FIEVEL GOES WEST
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh.
B:	Oh, I've seen, uh, previews for them on T V,
B:	but I,
A:	But, uh, those were, those were okay,
A:	so, And then, oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the movies,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I, we've rented some videos.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I like to rent movies, too.
A:	And I think the last one I rented was, uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS with Demi Moore.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, I, I didn't see that.
A:	And, uh, that, that, that's okay.
A:	That's pretty good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, and, uh, WHAT ABOUT BOB?
B:	I have seen that at the theatres,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we rented that one.
B:	That, that was cute.
A:	And, uh, uh, I guess that's about it.
A:	Have you rented any movies lately?
B:	Uh, the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox
B:	and, uh,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that was good.
A:	We rented that one, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I liked that.
B:	I like Michael J. Fox a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	He's one of my favorites.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I like his movies.
A:	So, do you go to the movies often,
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	not too often.
B:	I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see.
B:	I just, you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, we have two little kids,
A:	so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies.
A:	We have to dig up a baby-sitter
A:	and And that's only the only time we can go out,
B:	Oh I see.
A:	so our time is scarce.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	But, uh, we, we, we we, you know, we're, we're big movie people
A:	and we try and do
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good. Uh,
B:	Really.
A:	It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, you know, college football.
A:	Is that all they're going to have to make money, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I didn't think that was the objective, to make money.
A:	But it seems like it is.
B:	Huh. It really is.
B:	I know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program. To get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You went to Indiana University?
B:	Uh, Purdue.
A:	Oh Purdue,
A:	okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, good.
B:	So.
A:	You're, you're a T I up in Sherman?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, very good.
B:	Are you from Dallas area?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm in the facilities there, down here in Dallas.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess football is the big sport down here, isn't it.
A:	Uh, certainly high school football, and college football,
A:	but again high school football is just so much fun to watch,
A:	because, uh, you know, not everybody plays of course, but they're still,
A:	it's good
A:	and it's still,
A:	you know the kids,
A:	and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you know they're going to class, you know.
B:	You heard of, Have you heard of Damon Bailey. The I U white guard that plays.
A:	It, it's, it's real amateur sports.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Well, last year, when he was in high school, they drew a crowd of like forty-one thousand for the state finals, when he played.
A:	Is that right?
A:	I never heard ,
A:	that's, uh,
A:	I never been in a football game in high school that had that many.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that's, I mean, that's pretty big.
B:	Like he's from Indiana,
B:	and he plays for Indiana now.
B:	And, Indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there.
B:	The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd
B:	You know, the high school games, I mean, that seems to be the big attraction, and college.
A:	Well, my office mate here, Earl, he, he goes to all the Maverick games
A:	and he loves that.
A:	He, he would be,
A:	this is a great question for him, uh, to talk about
A:	Like he's got,
A:	I'm looking at his calendar,
A:	he's got all over the place,
A:	and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything.
A:	But, I, I, I can't get interested at all,
A:	zero.
A:	I, I listen to him,
A:	and occasionally I'll watch them on channel eleven,
A:	but gee,
A:	I can't, uh,
A:	more than five minutes of a basketball game, just seems about,
A:	that's it,
A:	of, uh, pro anyway.
B:	Yeah,
B:	seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play,
A:	Yeah.
B:	then it'd be the same result.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because they, they start,
B:	they shoot so much,
B:	and then the last, what, five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work.
A:	Mavericks had, oh two players this year that they got rid of last year.
A:	I'll think of them in a minute.
A:	Perkins, Sam Perkins,
A:	can't think of the other one.
A:	They're both.
B:	Tarpley,
B:	is he one?
A:	Pardon me?
B:	Tarpley?
A:	Yeah,
A:	Tarpley,
A:	and they both left this past year,
A:	and both of them were on playoff teams, uh,
A:	so, they benefitted tremendously by leaving the Mavericks.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And Sam Perkins, here, he's one guy I did follow
A:	from,
A:	think he was in Virginia,
A:	I can't think of what school he went to,
A:	but from.
A:	I guess he's been here about five, six, seven years in the pros.
A:	And he was,
A:	he never quite achieved the, you know, the super stardom that he had in, in college,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, basketball, they have a nice,
A:	I don't know if you've down to the sports for Reunion Arena.
A:	It's,
A:	Well, what kind of garden do you have?
B:	Well, we've tried having,
B:	let me turn the T V off,
B:	we've tried having a vegetable garden,
B:	and I'm from Chicago,
B:	and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago.
B:	And we have tried several years in a row,
B:	and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,
B:	and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
A:	Oh.
B:	We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,
B:	and, uh, if you really water a lot, you can do it,
B:	but, you know, when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, right now we're just,
A:	Do you have a lawn?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees.
B:	We have a peach tree.
B:	That's the extent of our, um, contributing to our food supply.
B:	But that's nice to have
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	yeah.
B:	So what do you do up there?
A:	Well, um, actually it,
A:	we've sort of had an ideal Spring.
B:	Um.
A:	And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	and the roses have been blooming for two weeks,
A:	and the grass is, uh, this lush green,
A:	and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, you know, I just keep looking at,
A:	and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.
B:	Really.
B:	Gosh.
A:	But, and my garden, you know,
A:	my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
B:	Oh, boy
A:	the plants and,
B:	that sounds wonderful.
A:	you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know,
A:	we'll have a freeze.
B:	If you don't have a frost you'll be all right
B:	That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost
B:	and half the stuff would get frostbitten,
B:	and you'd have to.
A:	Well, that's it.
A:	Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January,
A:	and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it,
A:	and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something
B:	Wow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, you know, everything just got hit hard
B:	Oh, boy,
B:	that's frustrating.
A:	So, but yeah,
A:	it, it's interesting,
A:	and I enjoy gardening.
A:	My son does the mowing of the grass.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me
A:	I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.
B:	I love gardens that are well tended,
B:	and I just,
B:	there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just
B:	I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,
B:	and just,
B:	I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long.
B:	And, uh, I, I was in England once,
B:	and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.
B:	You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it.
B:	Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old
A:	Oh, they help you.
B:	So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you
A:	Oh dear.
A:	Oh but that's nice, you know,
A:	I mean the peach tree is, is a start
A:	and,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's really lovely.
B:	I would love to have different fruit trees.
B:	It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches.
B:	They're just delicious.
B:	And, we, we we have, still have to spray some,
B:	but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,
B:	because I just,
B:	I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.
A:	Right.
A:	What about tomatoes,
A:	aren't they pretty hardy?
B:	Um, we've tried them,
B:	but again, it's just like the sun scorch.
A:	Oh.
B:	We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the
B:	I mean it's just,
B:	you really, really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,
A:	Oh.
B:	and um, that's really what makes the most sense,
B:	because you don't have to use so much water,
B:	and
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it really does the job.
B:	But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here.
B:	And if you're not really committed to it,
B:	I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,
B:	and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something,
B:	and by then it's burned up, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,
B:	so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that
A:	Well, I would assume, too,
A:	I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it just gets so hot so fast here.
B:	We don't have really a Spring or a Fall
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it just, uh, immediately heats up.
B:	So, that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, um, you know, the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.
B:	It was really nice.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago.
B:	In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it.
B:	I'll never forget.
B:	Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner.
B:	I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him
B:	They remodeled the entire back yard.
B:	Then they sold the house and got divorced,
B:	so I don't know what that says about it all
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	Oh, but she used to love to do stuff like that.
A:	Sounds like it would have been pretty.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really was.
B:	I enjoyed it there.
B:	But maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,
B:	because they like to see things grow.
B:	They've done a couple of little seed projects,
B:	and so I think it would be fun for them.
A:	Oh, sure,
A:	sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full
B:	Oh, yes
B:	They're both running around now.
A:	And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,
A:	but it's not off the list.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, it's very therapeutic,
B:	I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They certainly enjoy that part of it
B:	It's just trying to keep anything.
B:	I planted bulbs last, uh, Fall on the side guard, and when I went out there in the Spring
B:	and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,
B:	and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
A:	Oh.
B:	He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with?
B:	At least he didn't eat them,
B:	I mean, I guess I could be thankful for that.
A:	Right.
A:	Maybe next year they'll do better.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
B:	If they survive this year.
B:	Oh, well, good luck to you.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, thanks.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	It was nice talking to you too.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay
B:	Have you ever, uh, organized a family reunion?
A:	Uh, no
A:	I have never organized one.
A:	But we are, we have one, uh, we are going to have one on Memorial Day, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They have had one the last two years. We go out to the, my dad's farm and, uh, and, you know, it is just a picnic and spend the night. Go fishing and stuff like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How many people usually show up?
A:	Oh, about ten.
B:	Oh, it is not that big.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Because, uh, we have had sort of weekends like that too.
A:	It,
B:	But I never thought of it really as a reunion.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I sort of think of a reunion with my, uh, all the extended family
A:	Everybody,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California.
B:	And some is in New York and North Carolina,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it gets,
B:	it is kind of hard to get get everybody organized.
B:	Uh, is there someone,
B:	do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there?
B:	Or,
A:	Uh, yes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	My, my, uh, dad has a house out there anyway.
B:	And there is, there is, uh,
B:	he keeps a uh, food out there, year round.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, so he does not live there though?
A:	Uh, no.
A:	It is, it is, it is like a country, country home.
B:	Vacation home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It sounds nice. Uh,
B:	are there kids that are there too, or mostly adults?
A:	Yeah.
A:	The grandchildren.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just a few.
A:	It just depends,
A:	uh, uh, all my grandparents are dead so, uh, there is, there are not, you know, none of them are there.
A:	And, and, uh, then an uncle is dead.
A:	So the, the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Are you all located in Texas?
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	We are in, we are all, uh,
A:	like they live up in Sherman.
A:	It is near Lake Texoma.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	uh, all of his children live in the Dallas area too.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	That to me is,
B:	yeah,
B:	Dallas I know of,
B:	Houston I know of,
B:	and that is about it In Texas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, you know, we have, uh, well,
B:	we all got together,
B:	it was about two years ago for,
B:	I was,
B:	I had graduated from college.
B:	And, uh, I was going to live in France for a year.
B:	And so my parents invited,
B:	it was not just family,
B:	it was friends too.
B:	But, uh, we all got together for just a party.
B:	And that was kind of fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that.
A:	French reunion?
B:	Well, not quite French,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, it was sort of a reunion before leaving.
B:	It was fun.
B:	It was on, uh, New Year's Day.
B:	So it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It was kind of fun.
B:	But, uh, but who was it?
B:	A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago
B:	and, you know, everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend.
B:	And it really sounded like it was fun.
B:	But, I am not quite sure what I would do.
B:	I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace, and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know. And have different areas to explore and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So that would be kind of fun.
B:	Yep.
B:	Where nobody lives
A:	Right.
B:	But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they do not have to clean up afterwards.
B:	Yep.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That is for sure.
B:	The cleaning up can be a mess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But uh, do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm?
A:	I am, I am sorry?
B:	Does, does your dad have horses there?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	he does not really have any, any, uh, uh, domestic livestock anyway.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, he leased, uh, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.
B:	I see,
B:	so it's,
B:	so he really does use it as a vacation home.
B:	It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Pretty much.
A:	He has a garden and, uh, a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that sounds nice.
B:	Do people actually pick the fruit and things?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then there is wild blackberries there too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, used to, we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property,
A:	he gets,
B:	but we never got enough.
B:	I used to make jam,
B:	but I never had enough to really make, you know, more than a jar or something.
A:	Huh.
B:	So it was not so worth it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is kind of, they're kind of off and on it seems like.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Depends on the rain.
B:	That sounds,
B:	is,
B:	does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there?
A:	Uh,
A:	it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.
B:	Well, that is pretty big
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I do not know how they do scale down there.
B:	You know, here it would be a huge amount of land.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because they,
B:	is
B:	this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres. As opposed to tens of acres.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh,
A:	and most of it, you know,
A:	you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We kind of have a, an informal contest.
A:	My uncle, uh, put some bass in, uh, his pond a few years ago.
A:	Well, he put some crappie too.
A:	But the bass,
A:	we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.
A:	So,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they are in there, but they are real spooky.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think my dad put some.
B:	We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too.
B:	And,
B:	I mean really little.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,
B:	and there were too many little goldfish,
B:	and so the big ones never got bigger.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again
A:	Never saw the bass?
B:	No.
A:	Oh.
B:	So we do not know whether it is living
B:	or,
A:	Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.
B:	Yep.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We still have lots of little goldfish.
B:	They propagate pretty well, those little fish.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah,
A:	they really do.
B:	because we started,
B:	we have got hundreds in there now,
B:	and we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar, you know, no matter how many it was for a dollar.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and some of them are probably eight inches long.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.
A:	Oh,
B:	And,
A:	yeah.
B:	It,
A:	They
A:	there is a, uh,
A:	you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there.
A:	I do not know if they would live very well up in New York,
A:	but they get huge.
A:	And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait for yellow catfish.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Well, we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, yeah.
B:	We could see.
B:	I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way.
B:	But catfish do, I think.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, that,
B:	you mean,
B:	well, we could try it.
B:	That is a good idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh,
B:	I forget,
B:	there's little, uh, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that. Minnow nets or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.
B:	And it was really funny,
B:	because, uh, one time he left the net in the pond,
B:	and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.
B:	And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond
B:	And that night he came out, and the trap was gone.
B:	And it was a raccoon that had taken it.
B:	So it was really funny.
B:	And you could see that, you know,
B:	you could see where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is what happens
B:	But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?
A:	Yeah
A:	And, uh, we feed the catfish.
A:	They feed the catfish like, uh, every couple of weeks.
A:	And, uh, and sometimes that is the best time to catch them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because they will just, they will just come after anything then.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you could catch a couple anyway during that time.
B:	What do you feed them?
A:	Uh, mixed Purina, uh,
A:	it is, uh, cat food, uh, catfish food.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it is especially made for catfish.
A:	But,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I do not know how much different it is from dog food but, you know, it is, uh, it looks like Purina High Pro.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That is funny.
A:	But they come up to the top.
A:	And it is the best time to take pictures,
A:	because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.
A:	And they're,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I have never seen catfish, you know, except in filleted on a plate, I think maybe.
B:	I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I have never seen them, just alive someplace.
B:	That would be fun to see.
A:	Well, they are really funny fish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they try to hit you with their tails.
B:	How big do they get?
A:	Oh, well, the channel catfish get up to, uh,
A:	I think the world record is fifty some pounds.
A:	Uh,
B:	Do you know?
A:	that, that is only about three and a half feet long.
B:	That is pretty big though.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they get real fat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, from the time,
A:	they, they stay slender until they get to be, uh, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, my daughter, we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing
A:	And I think that was when she was three.
A:	And she caught a catfish by accident.
A:	She was fishing for sunfish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she said, "Here," and she handed me her rod and reel
A:	And, and, uh, you know, it was just pulling drag out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it swimmed wherever it wanted to.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That sounds amazing.
B:	I will have to see them sometime.
B:	But, all righty.
A:	Okay.
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you too.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Enjoy your, uh, weekend.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have a nice Memorial weekend.
B:	Okay.
B:	You too.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	now you can tell me what you do.
B:	Uh, well, I work with computers, just like your son
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I actually do research in speech recognition
A:	Oh, great.
B:	part of the reason I'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I was working
B:	well, actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se uh, recently
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	Well, the one John works for seems to have a you know, good benefits,
A:	and the pay is decent.
B:	Yeah
B:	the, uh,
B:	well actually, where I was working the company
B:	one of the companies I was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days I think are really important
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because health care is so ridiculously expensive.
B:	Because we're, we're paying our own insurance right now.
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But and I'm,
B:	we actually had a little baby so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.
A:	Oh,
A:	Great,
A:	I had, I had a granddaughter
B:	Oh, congratulations.
B:	And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits
B:	because it's more important with a family
A:	Right.
B:	and you know, our doctor's routine doctor's visits covered,
B:	my health insurance only covers, um, the emergency care.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have major medical benefits?
B:	Right, yeah,
B:	but I don't,
A:	That, that helps some,
A:	if,
A:	it depends on what your deductible is how high it is.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, my,
B:	our deductible's five hundred
B:	but it's for each event.
A:	Each person.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's pretty that's pretty high,
B:	Right
B:	but, you know, so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick
A:	Right.
B:	it doesn't cover doctor's visits, things like that.
A:	That's, that's right.
A:	And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical, too.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it certainly is.
B:	Uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know where my daughter works,
A:	now she, she,
A:	course we live in a, a rural sort of setting
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and where she works she has no benefits at all.
B:	Wow.
A:	And her wage is not, not very good
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's, it's the type of area we live in.
A:	Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.
B:	And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.
A:	Well, she has to pay for it herself
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.
A:	But, uh
B:	So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,
B:	and so the insurance would cost lower,
A:	Uh, well, from what I've seen,
A:	from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here,
A:	they're not that much different.
B:	Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.
A:	Is that right?
B:	And they were at one of the better hospitals, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, good doctors in Boston.
A:	Wow
A:	that's a big difference.
B:	And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But that's a huge difference just between
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	should be.
B:	So I was pretty shocked at that.
B:	But the other thing that I'm really concerned about,
B:	and most companies don't have,
B:	some are starting to have, is day care
B:	because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.
B:	And I'd go to work,
B:	and if she were sick I could go down and see her, if she needs to be fed, whatever.
A:	And it would be much more convenient.
A:	Yeah
B:	And I,
A:	it would be more convenient, too.
B:	It would be more convenient, more productive I think,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	My other daughter works and has,
A:	they have to take their two children to day care, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it, it's,
A:	I don't know how they do it,
A:	I really don't. You know,
A:	getting them there and then, and going to work, and then picking them up and, all the preparations.
B:	And, and your hours are, much more constrained and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, that, to me, well, that, you know,
B:	those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care are probably the most important benefits.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, uh, retirement plans
B:	but,
A:	Oh, I don't know,
A:	I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If you can get those benefits even, uh,
A:	they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.
B:	Right
B:	because you're, you know,
B:	certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I would certainly accept a lower salary for that. You know, everything else being equal
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it would make it a lot better.
B:	because your life would be so much easier.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there's a question of quality of life also.
A:	Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on probably, you know, with your child.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and, you, you, you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened. And, you're less preoccupied with it, I think.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	But unfortunately, there aren't,
B:	I think I B M has started having that in certain locations.
A:	I don't know,
A:	my daughter, one daughter works for M C I,
A:	and they don't, they, where she works they don't have anything like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is that locally?
A:	Uh, Pittsburgh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
B:	Yeah
B:	because Pittsburgh's a big enough city, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones. Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like, uh, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, um, any where between ten and forty hours a week. And, um, call my own days, call my own hours,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, so they were very flexible
B:	Yeah,
A:	and that, that would be great,
A:	yeah.
B:	and which
B:	many times at a large company it's almost impossible to do things like that.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	They say you're going to do it this way, and that's the way it's going to be.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	So it all depends on what your position is there, too.
A:	True,
A:	well, that's true in any, any company, I think.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've, I've never, well I can't say I've never,
A:	I've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the you know, out of the home
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, the rest of the time I've been an Avon lady and a lady.
B:	Was that when you were, um, well,
B:	those have its pluses and minuses, too.
B:	I've been a consultant recently and so I don't have any benefits at all
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself,
A:	yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and the same thing
B:	my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, they, they, they,
A:	Usually consultants make very good income.
B:	Right,
B:	and they, they refuse to give him more salary.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Because they say they can't pay more than this and that, and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, times are rough now,
B:	so it's, new,
B:	it's harder to get the, uh, you know, increases and things
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um,
A:	A consultant really is, should be more knowledgeable than everybody else, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	well he's,
A:	so it stands to reason they should really have more benefits.
B:	Right,
B:	well, he's been doing a long term,
B:	he's being called a consultant,
B:	and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, they, they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits,
B:	he doesn't get, well
A:	Um.
B:	we don't care about retirement benefits.
B:	He doesn't get, um, vacation benefits
B:	and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So really his salary should be, you know, twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that, not including the fact that you know, it's a less, long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they'll do it,
A:	Do you or your husband work for T I,
A:	or
B:	I'm a contract person at T I in fact involved with, uh, Data Switchboard
A:	Oh, are you,
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	Well, that's neat.
B:	and, uh, do you work for T I?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now, I guess.
B:	Oh, you sound very young like just out of college
A:	Right,
A:	I try to,
A:	I try to think of myself as young,
A:	but, uh, well, have you seen any movies recently?
B:	Uh, I'm trying to think,
B:	we saw, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	and, uh, have you seen that one?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't,
A:	I have, have a hard time with movies that are real long.
B:	That was excellent.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Well, so oddly enough, I do too,
B:	I get tired of sitting there, and so does my husband,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but we both just thoroughly, you know enjoyed it, just really liked it
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
B:	and, uh, I'm trying to think,
B:	we went to see a, uh, a real funny one,
B:	I can't think now what the name of it was
B:	I've gone blank.
A:	We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF
B:	Oh, we have not seen that,
B:	we want to see that one.
A:	and that was, that was pretty funny,
A:	and then we saw,
A:	what was the spoof on TOP GUN,
A:	it's
B:	Oh, I haven't seen that one.
A:	oh, I can't think of what that was called.
A:	We saw that too,
A:	I was pretty disappointed in that one.
B:	Were you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh, so, you know, through the summer,
A:	we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.
B:	My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,
B:	he likes to rent them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home as they come out,
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh,
A:	Have you seen GHOSTS yet?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	I really, I enjoyed that movie,
B:	Did you?
B:	Now I, I was real disappointed
A:	Really.
B:	I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I was really disappointed in it,
B:	it
B:	one,
B:	I don't think it was as funny as what I was anticipating,
B:	and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny and, uh, and it wasn't you know, at all,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	well,
A:	Yeah.
B:	it was, it was more of a love story
A:	Yeah,
B:	and, uh, so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We just got through watching one with, uh, uh, is it Claude Van Damme yeah, and, uh, enjoyed it,
A:	Uh, Van Damme,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think,
B:	I can't think what the name of
B:	it was a, uh, of course, one of the typical you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and we enjoyed that,
B:	and, uh, the, uh, uh, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it?
A:	Oh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
B:	Yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	I did.
B:	Wasn't that excellent?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I really enjoyed that a lot.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was one that, that stayed with me you know, for a month,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I just,
B:	I kept thinking about it, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's amazing,
A:	but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie
B:	No.
A:	and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,
B:	Oh, it was excellent,
B:	and, and, of course, he's such a, uh, very good actor anyway
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, I think he made the movie,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do too,
A:	I really did
B:	Yeah,
A:	you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,
A:	I agree with you.
B:	Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?
A:	Oh, Hopkins,
A:	I'm sorry
B:	Hopkins,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Hopkins,
A:	yeah.
A:	I always get those mixed up.
B:	I know
B:	I know.
B:	It, uh, well,
B:	I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,
B:	but I thought she was good in that.
A:	Well, I
A:	well, I haven't been,
A:	I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS,
A:	and I thought that was a pretty good movie,
A:	but I thought she,
B:	Now, I didn't see that one.
A:	That was, that was pretty interesting movie,
A:	and, uh, but, you know, I, I did,
A:	I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
A:	that was really intriguing,
A:	and it, it didn't scare me all that much, you know,
A:	and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,
A:	that's not why I go
B:	No,
B:	no
A:	so,
B:	I like a good suspenseful story,
A:	Right,
A:	and that one was.
B:	and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,
B:	in fact, I want to, uh, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,
B:	because, he didn't
A:	Oh, he didn't see it?
B:	he won't go see that,
B:	no,
A:	Oh.
B:	I went with, uh, our daughter and, uh, so, you know, saw it with her, and, uh, enjoyed it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Did you see it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen it.
B:	Oh, I've seen it, you know,
B:	we saw it at the movies,
B:	and then we've rented it several times
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, we just love it,
B:	in fact we have a ten year old grandson that,
B:	he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle you know, just get hysterical.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen that.
A:	It's pretty, it's pretty cute.
A:	I guess, you know, as far as comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	yes,
A:	I love that movie,
B:	My husband liked that
A:	Yeah,
A:	so,
B:	uh, he's a big Gene Wilder fan,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me,
A:	but I'm a big, uh, Mel Brooks fan
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	all his movies, I really, really .
B:	He has a new one out.
A:	He does?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I have seen it advertised.
B:	I don't know what the name of it is.
A:	Oh, is that the one with, that's he's starring in?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that came out, like early in the summer or something like that.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I haven't seen that one either.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my husband wants to see that one,
B:	and, uh, did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the, uh, the sheriff
A:	Oh, BLAZING SADDLES.
B:	BLAZING SADDLES.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	I like, I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was better.
B:	Did you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,
A:	I just really enjoyed it,
A:	and, uh, um, I'm trying to think,
A:	because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.
A:	I'm trying to remember what it was,
A:	because it, you know, it's,
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
A:	Capital punishment.
B:	Okay,
B:	what's your views on it?
A:	Um, for myself, I'm personally against it,
A:	but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but, but do not use it.
B:	Correct.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, I'm for it.
B:	I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.
B:	I, I feel like that child molestation and murder
B:	I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.
B:	I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,
B:	and of course Texas has it, but they very seldom, you know, put it into effect.
B:	So instead all of our prisons are full of people on, you know a lot of people on death row.
A:	Okay, well,
A:	Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.
B:	Well, uh, yeah
A:	Texas is a big state,
B:	which is not very often.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, here in Maryland to the capital punishment law,
A:	people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, but no one, no one has, actually has the sentence carried out.
A:	Uh, I'd certainly,
B:	What do they do, just keep them on death row for the rest of their life.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, uh,
A:	or affair number
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, in fact, I think that, it, it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,
A:	the sentence of life without possibility of parole, uh, has become a common one, and is being, being used much more.
B:	Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here?
A:	Uh, I don't know the exact numbers,
A:	but, but yes,
A:	prisons are overcrowded.
B:	I know that we have, you know,
B:	really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,
B:	and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,
B:	and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,
B:	and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,
B:	and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it
A:	Um.
B:	uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
A:	Okay,
A:	you're, you're certainly in the majority uh, at least in this country.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.
B:	I know they use it very, um,
B:	they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.
A:	No,
A:	at least not in Western Europe.
A:	Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either.
A:	Um, there are many reasons for it,
A:	but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.
B:	Yes,
B:	you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.
A:	Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,
A:	arguably, if
A:	arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.
A:	Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.
B:	Well, England has, uh, don't they have a large, fairly large welfare?
A:	Yes,
A:	oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.
A:	I, I, I,
A:	however the question is is that making the difference.
B:	Oh, I, I don't know.
B:	But we have a lot of welfare programs
B:	and
A:	Oh.
B:	if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,
B:	you know, or is it,
B:	in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.
A:	Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.
B:	Oh, do you?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's interesting.
B:	I would not have, I would not have said that.
B:	I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.
B:	That's an interesting theory.
B:	I'm not that familiar, you know,
B:	I've only been over there a couple of times
B:	and I'm not that familiar with, that,
A:	Me, too.
B:	all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in, uh,
A:	Okay.
B:	Why don't you go ahead and start.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,
A:	and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, the TIME of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy
A:	and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course.
A:	And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, well, I have, in a for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, uh, I have so much going on in my life
B:	that seems to be the last thing I pick up,
B:	so I found that I was wasting my money. As much as I enjoy them, uh, when I do subscribe
B:	I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and, uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine
A:	Uh-huh
B:	uh.
A:	you probably have smaller children younger children.
B:	Yes,
B:	yeah,
A:	My children, our children are grown
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	and, uh, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
B:	Right,
B:	well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,
B:	so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.
B:	Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,
B:	so I figured it wasn't, uh, something I needed at this point in time.
A:	Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?
B:	I don't know,
B:	I, I, well,
B:	my husband would love to have more.
B:	Now he's the type who will get the, uh, INC. magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines,
A:	Yes,
A:	now my husband does that,
A:	and
B:	Yeah,
A:	you know, and of course, uh, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL, you know and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	but I don't know,
A:	I know a few people leafing through them at the store
A:	but you just don't hear people talk about them,
A:	and I know years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, I just loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL, McCALL'S, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING,
A:	and I took them all
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, then, oh, I don't know what
A:	in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I haven't,
A:	I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be
B:	Well
A:	even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,
B:	yeah,
B:	and some of those have had what, what I consider or what
B:	I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.
B:	They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads.
A:	Oh, they are.
A:	My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she sends them to me,
A:	and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	Yes.
B:	Right
A:	you know, and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living you know, then I can, I look through them
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I do,
A:	I just,
A:	what I do is I flip through them and, and pitch them then, you know,
A:	they're not something I, you know, take any length of time over.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book than a magazine.
B:	Yes
B:	I enjoy books a lot more
A:	Yes
B:	that's true.
A:	and, uh.
B:	Well
A:	So, but.
B:	now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to,
B:	other than my children have gotten.
B:	You know, they get tons of magazines it seems
A:	Yes
B:	they're always getting something in the mail
B:	and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper,
B:	and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance,
B:	but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,
B:	unless you just want to skim through while you're,
B:	I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	I will read them in a doctor's office, too.
B:	Yeah,
A:	As I said, I, I subscribe to, uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME,
A:	and, uh, and I will go through the TIME, but, usually not cover to cover, you know,
A:	I'll glance through it.
A:	I like reading, uh, you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something you know,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine.
A:	It, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that,
A:	I enjoy that.
A:	It's quick reading you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it doesn't require a lot of thinking,
A:	and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I don't want a lot of thinking
B:	That's true,
B:	that kind of is a good way to do it.
A:	It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing.
A:	Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world
A:	so. Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and, uh
B:	Okay.
A:	so, uh, I think that probably I will end the call.
A:	I've enjoyed,
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.
A:	I get most of my news information from T V.
A:	Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I find it one of the best.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels eight or five.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, where do you get yours?
B:	Uh, mostly from T V too.
B:	I usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty and six sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
B:	and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know,
B:	but not very often do I read the whole thing.
B:	Quite often just scan through the headlines
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
A:	and, and my husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say, you know, here you need to read this
A:	and, uh I don't know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it,
A:	I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers.
A:	It just seems like I was so busy all the time,
A:	and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, uh, things like that
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so I
A:	and it got so depressing
B:	Yeah
A:	Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news
B:	Yeah.
B:	If there's something, you know, that I want to know more about or
B:	might be the Killeen murders.
B:	I've been kind of intrigued.
B:	I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone
B:	You just,
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
A:	I, I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there
A:	I'll go through and read it.
A:	Uh, but I find that I do better with, oh, remembering it and everything if I watch, uh, the T V you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and they kind of capsize it and everything
B:	Yeah.
A:	and watch,
A:	and I think sometimes it's, you know maybe a little biased, you know
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and sometimes. You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	You know.
B:	I wanted a little more detail like, you know,
B:	they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were.
B:	And I guess you just, you know, you you just want to know
B:	and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.
B:	And that made you even feel a little more kin to, to what was going on.
B:	Well, you know, of the same, same type of church that we belong to.
A:	Oh, the same type of church.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also
B:	so.
A:	Oh, uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So that was interesting,
B:	but I enjoy the news.
B:	I, I think our seven year old even once in a while will sit down and watch it with us,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so.
A:	I used to, uh,
A:	or I didn't used to
A:	but, uh
B:	No.
A:	when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I thought that was very interesting,
A:	and I thought that was very important for kids.
A:	Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.
B:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that.
A:	The oldest one he's nine
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, he would particularly enjoy this
A:	been a couple of years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting.
A:	Actually I even understood it better
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know. And, uh, but as I said, uh, I you know,
B:	Right.
A:	Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it
B:	or,
A:	Yes.
A:	We like channel eight.
B:	Do you?
A:	We like it.
A:	It's the best.
B:	Um, channel five for some reason has always been the one I watch.
A:	Is that been your favorite?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I don't know
B:	it's probably the anchors.
B:	They just kind of catch you.
B:	I don't, I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I very
A:	and I thought it was very interesting, uh,
A:	channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and going on.
A:	They were having news coverage
A:	and,
B:	The C N N, is that what that is?
A:	No,
A:	it was channel nine.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so we had the T V on
A:	and we were trying to catch all of it,
A:	and they were showing some
A:	and I was watching,
A:	my husband and I were watching it,
A:	and then we switched over to channel eight,
A:	and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I can understand why channel eleven is, uh, you know, why they're kind of behind.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Did I say channel nine to begin with?
B:	Yeah
B:	That's why I wondered.
A:	No
A:	Okay.
A:	No, channel eleven I meant.
B:	I don't get that channel
B:	Yeah.
A:	I was thinking nine to ten.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But channel eleven,
B:	That is if you, if you want to go to bed early
B:	it's nice to, to, to watch that early news sometimes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so.
A:	It, uh,
A:	but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, you know, switched over to channel eight
A:	and they didn't
A:	Okay,
A:	would you, uh, like to begin or would you like me to start?
B:	Uh, oh, I can start.
A:	Okay.
B:	I, I think one of the, the biggest, uh, improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into, uh, management
A:	Yes.
B:	and you're seeing them, uh, get, uh, elected to, uh, political offices. Uh, not near enough.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know there's still a long way to go especially in top management
A:	Yes,
A:	I agree.
B:	You're not seeing, you know,
B:	looking at T I, you see them in management, but you're not seeing them up there as V P
A:	Right.
B:	And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City,
B:	and I know the company that she was with, uh,
B:	the women didn't have near the positions, the levels that the men attorneys had. And were not, uh, given the same respect.
A:	Right.
A:	I agree with that.
A:	I, I think you do see more and more women out there in politics, too, as mayors or, uh, you know, in, in helping to maybe, uh, get some legislation passed to, to have women have more rights.
B:	Yes.
A:	I think still, even with that whole, um, thing with Judge Thomas and, and, uh, you, you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man
A:	or something the way they had the trial
A:	and uh, I just think that it's, it's still going to take another generation or so before, before the women really, could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Uh, but it's still, uh,
A:	going from, from homemakers into, uh, corporate leaders is still a big step.
B:	Right,
B:	I also think that, uh, uh, women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be.
B:	Used to be people would say, do you work, and you'd say, no, I work in the home
B:	and
A:	Right.
B:	it was, it was, then it was almost like a put down, particularly, particularly even by women in the work force.
B:	But, I think now, I think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very, very important.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it's getting the respect and, which is about time.
A:	I think it's true.
A:	I think also people are having children at a older age
B:	Yes,
B:	very definitely.
A:	so it's maybe like, uh, you know,
A:	you go through college
A:	and then you maybe work for a few years
A:	and then you have your first child
A:	and, uh, you know, you, you know both sides of the coin.
B:	That's right.
A:	You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly, and to take care of the kids.
A:	And, and then, uh, maybe people that are just working and think, oh, you just stay at home.
A:	But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid, it's like, they lose it
B:	Right.
A:	They say, wow!
A:	This is harder than I thought
B:	Yes
A:	Well, you know.
B:	And, and, to those that have never worked and had, you know, and have stayed home with the kids, kind of does your heart good
A:	I know it,
A:	I know.
B:	Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so, you know, it, it kind of does me good.
B:	I think also one of the things that, that's really tremendous and, it doesn't necessarily have to do with women, but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families.
A:	Are so involved.
A:	Yes.
B:	Which, again, I think it helps a woman's role.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	You know,
A:	Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us, too.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I know,
A:	I have three children
A:	and my oldest is eleven
A:	and I've pretty much been home, uh, since Brian was born
A:	and, uh, just recently I went back to work, uh, last school semester to tutor, uh, high school age students with learning disabilities
A:	and I was just out of the house two days a week
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, I thought, wow, this is really hard,
A:	only,
A:	and it was only two days
A:	and I was home before three.
A:	But getting the baby to day care, getting the kids off to school, I still did everything I always do, you know,
A:	my husband still got up and went to work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, it, it,
A:	only those two,
A:	it made a big difference.
A:	I thought, wow, full time,
A:	I don't think I could swing that personally.
B:	Well, I had to,
B:	course, I work full time,
B:	but my daughter and her husband were out of town
B:	so I had my grandchildren for four days during, uh, football, soccer season
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	and so I would work
B:	and her,
B:	some friends would take care of the kids,
B:	but I would have to get them picked up from there get them fed, get them to practices get homework done, get baths.
A:	Pick up. Dinner.
A:	Right.
B:	I was absolutely exhausted.
A:	I bet,
A:	I bet.
B:	And, and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties, or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.
A:	Well, I, I know a lot of people,
A:	I know I had my first child when I was twenty-five,
A:	and that's not considered really young these days,
A:	that's almost, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I have friends that, that have kids just starting kindergarten
A:	and they're, they're forty years old.
A:	And, and then like maybe a two year old at home,
A:	and I think, boy, I, I'm, I'm in my
A:	Okay,
A:	do we just go ahead?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Do you want to start?
A:	Uh, well, we're supposed to talk about vacations
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on that I liked the most
A:	and probably the one I liked most was Hawaii
B:	Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii?
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.
B:	It's lovely, isn't it?
A:	Yes.
A:	We went, uh, six months after we were married.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we just went to, uh, two islands.
B:	What islands did you go to?
A:	We went to Oahu and Kauai.
B:	Kauai,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	We went to Kauai,
B:	and then we also hit Maui,
B:	and then, of course, uh
A:	The big one.
B:	uh, the big one,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It was.
B:	But the other two were just lovely.
A:	Yes,
A:	I enjoyed Kauai better, too.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.
B:	It wasn't commercialized.
A:	Oh, it was rainy
B:	Yeah
B:	was it?
A:	Rainy,
A:	but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
A:	so,
B:	That's right.
B:	Well, it wasn't real rainy.
B:	We had a few showers, but, uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
B:	and, and, when, uh,
B:	now we went to Nassau
B:	and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he really did.
B:	I don't know why.
B:	You know, he didn't like Oahu at all
B:	He thought
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Did you go there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was wonderful
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we both enjoyed it very much.
A:	That was That was nice,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, I've been to Nassau, too.
B:	Have you?
A:	I went on a cruise.
B:	Oh, neat.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and, uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather just go to the island.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, our son and daughter-in-law just, uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise.
B:	And I know they didn't like it.
B:	Now, we have several friends that, uh, have been on, and just love them.
B:	But James and I like,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I think we would get bored on the boat all the time.
A:	Well, I, got sick.
B:	Oh, did you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I did the first night.
A:	I went with my sister just, uh, a couple years ago
B:	Ooh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and we both, the first night, just had to leave dinner.
B:	Um.
A:	It was bad,
A:	but, and then after that it was, it got better,
A:	but we just,
A:	it was a four day
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we were both ready to get off the boat.
B:	Were you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day.
B:	Now we've been real lucky.
B:	We've been to Europe twice.
A:	Oh, have you?
B:	Yeah.
B:	We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and touched a little bit of Scotland
B:	And second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved Germany.
A:	Oh.
B:	It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains
A:	Wow.
A:	I'll bet it is.
B:	and we were there in the fall before the snows, you know, started
B:	and it was wonderful.
B:	It, uh it was just, it was marvelous.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we would love to go back there
B:	and we'd love to go back to London.
A:	You haven't been to Spain?
B:	No
A:	Oh.
B:	have not been to Spain.
A:	I was born there.
B:	Were you?
A:	Yes
B:	How old were you when you left?
A:	Uh, just ten months.
B:	Oh, ten months,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so,
B:	Have you ever got to go back?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	and I would like to.
B:	Would you?
B:	My, uh, my sister,
B:	we went with them to Germany
B:	and, uh, she would like to go to Spain.
B:	I'm not sure whether I would like to or not.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, uh, I would like to go to Ireland.
A:	Would you?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from the the problems.
B:	Well, the
B:	there is
B:	uh-huh,
B:	is, is a little scary,
B:	but I would still like to see it.
B:	I'd like to see, uh, Italy.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I would love to go there.
A:	That would be nice.
B:	And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, you know, go to.
A:	Now, have you been to Yellowstone?
B:	Uh,
A:	Yellowstone,
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Have you?
B:	We have been there.
B:	We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they loved it.
A:	Well,
B:	I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt Lake.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, it's at
B:	Yeah.
A:	my husband works in Salt Lake,
A:	so
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we're real close
A:	and, yeah,
A:	we,
B:	Now that's a pretty city.
A:	Yes,
A:	we, we like it.
B:	Very clean. You know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is.
B:	Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.
A:	Well, we kind of like it
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?
B:	We,
B:	no,
B:	we used to
B:	We used to camp a lot with our
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, you like the motels?
B:	We like the motels,
B:	yes
A:	Oh, oh, well.
B:	We have, we've gone past the camping stage.
B:	We lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys
B:	and it was beautiful
B:	and our kids loved it and everything
B:	and then we moved to, uh, uh, the Dallas area
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's hot down here
B:	and camping is not near as much fun.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside. And, uh, although our son loves to fish
A:	Huh.
B:	and, uh, and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I've been concerned about crime lately.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood?
B:	Well, I, I think we have a neighborhood watch
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think.
B:	I'm not real,
B:	we don't get real involved.
B:	We're never home,
B:	so
A:	Uh-huh
B:	uh, uh, well, I know they were going to start one,
B:	but, uh, I haven't heard any more since,
B:	so I don't really know.
B:	But as far as personally doing something, no.
A:	No, um.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well we moved in, when we moved in, there, there wasn't any outside lights
A:	and so we've been trying to install some, uh, outside lights
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we put up a fence in the backyard.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Mostly, you know, not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in, but that our children would be safe playing in the yard. You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	And I guess most of the crime that I'm concerned about generally is against my kids. To let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything
B:	Oh, I'm sure it is.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I have to spend a good deal of time watching them walk down the street and, say, call me before you leave and come back
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	We don't have any.
B:	We did install a, a a, uh, motion detector light back in our driveway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that was, mainly it was so when we pulled up, the light would come on,
B:	but also we have a boat back there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief,
B:	so
B:	we thought with that light, you know, it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat
B:	Yeah
B:	so,
A:	Well, we've been real lucky that,
A:	I don't believe there's been, you know, much trouble in our neighborhood,
A:	but it  but it does seem there, that there is a lot more here in Plano of, uh, just bored teenagers
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's
A:	Vandalism.
B:	what it is.
B:	We live in, Coppell
B:	and, and that's pretty much what it is, is you know, kids that are bored, like you say.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they don't, uh,
A:	I know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and a few things like that
B:	Oh, no.
A:	and, course, you know,
A:	I don't know
A:	I'm getting scared for kids to get older,
A:	because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who, and, or is it just random crime,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the, anywhere that they live has had, been a victim of, you know, a serious crime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, But, I guess I take a lot of, uh, little bit of, uh, safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are, like drug related or uh, things that,
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	places usually that I wouldn't be going. And things I usually wouldn't be involved in.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it is scary.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	Were you raised in this area?
B:	Really is
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm originally from Chicago, but I've been in this area, in the Lewisville area for, uh, let's see, about twenty-three years.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, has it been getting worse that you noticed, or  about the same?
B:	Oh  definitely.
A:	Um.
B:	In the last few years, I think,
B:	and, uh, like I say,
B:	now I don't think necessarily in this area here, but just Dallas in general.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I think back of when I was, uh, younger and in my party days, some of the things I did, you know, I wouldn't be caught dead, like, being out that late at night.
A:	Right.
B:	In the dark parking lot
A:	Right.
A:	Take a lot of chances.
A:	Well, I noticed that, uh, that, uh, when
A:	we, we moved here from Houston not too long ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, of course, we were interested in schools
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, but the schools in Houston all have big, tall fences around them
A:	and they're not really very safe
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them,
A:	and it's just a whole different idea that, that, at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school.
B:	Huh.
A:	And so that's been something that's been good for the, you know, in this area that you feel like, uh, you know, there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I guess,
A:	I don't know how people live with that every day.
B:	Um.
B:	I don't either.
A:	Pretty scary.
B:	Yeah, um.
A:	But, anyway, well, I guess I won't take up more of your
A:	Well, I am new to Texas,
A:	so I don't even know what the law is, in the state,
B:	Uh-huh?
A:	do you?
B:	Well, yes,
B:	of course, we do have capital punishment.
B:	And we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.
A:	Oh, that's right,
A:	I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.
B:	Yes.
A:	Um, you know, different things,
A:	is it restricted to certain crimes?
A:	Or just,
B:	Yes,
B:	it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape, this sort of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um. Well.
B:	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
A:	Yes,
A:	I know,
A:	the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent
A:	and, they want,
A:	I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	I just,
A:	I can't see that.
B:	That happens on occasion,
B:	it sure does,
B:	maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I don't know,
B:	or a person personally.
A:	No.
B:	I think I would be, you know,
B:	I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty,
B:	I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.
B:	I don't know that it is.
B:	I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.
A:	Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	oh, absolutely,
B:	yeah,
B:	it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.
A:	it's really sad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I just think, um,
A:	somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting, the feeling that it
B:	Yes.
A:	with,
A:	someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.
A:	Is really kind of bad
B:	Yes
B:	it is.
B:	It's a tough, tough question.
B:	It really is.
B:	I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.
B:	Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
A:	and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
B:	Oh, absolutely.
B:	that's right.
A:	Oh, I don't know,
A:	is it,
A:	do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
B:	Not with me personally.
B:	It is with a lot of other people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not, not to me personally,
B:	no.
A:	Um.
B:	No.
A:	I don't know,
A:	sometimes I feel,
A:	I mean I do go to church and things.
A:	I don't know how I would feel about it.
A:	But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
B:	That's a, it's a tough, tough question,
B:	it really is.
A:	Do you think most states have that
A:	So,  so he had to have a work visa there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	And of course they had a lot of musicians from, from other countries  and, uh, in the Mexico City Symphony.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I think, um, like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	But I think the conductor, I don't know, or one of the conductors is, is from another country.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's like any other symphony.
B:	Yeah
A:	You know, and then, and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico
A:	so he had to,
A:	Well, I, um, I haven't really lived in a lot of big cities.
A:	I mean, I'm living in Dallas now.
A:	Plano is outside of Dallas,
A:	but, um, so I don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	But, I know when I lived down in Houston, on the outskirts of Houston, there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And, um, if you would drive by there, like on your way to the beach or something, there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke, into the air
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and it always smelled really bad.
A:	We know that, that was really, really, really bad for the atmosphere.
A:	What have you got up there?
B:	Well, I, I live out in the country,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	so that part is good.
B:	Uh, we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh,
B:	which has a lot of pollution from their plants,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator. *sp: we're
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And, uh, it won't be too for from where we live. *sp: far
B:	And everybody really has been, you know, fighting against it, because we, we do not want it.
B:	Well, we don't want one any place
A:	Sure.
B:	we would like the, uh, industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, uh, the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much. Huh-uh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's just, I mean, it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air
A:	and, and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there, and everywhere, it all adds up. *there they're
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Plus all the problems in the Middle East.
A:	With all that smoke and,
B:	Oh, that has to be terrible over there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So it's just, um, why are we doing this to ourselves
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	I just don't know,
A:	but, um, I, you know, what really amazes me about, like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries, is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, between the freeway and the oil refinery, you would see a neighborhood.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and you just thought, well, it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there,
A:	and what comes up, must come down
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Breathing it, we're breathing it all the time.
A:	Yes.
A:	And, and how, if they have all of those, um,
A:	toxicity, I mean, it, there's signs around saying how dangerous it is
A:	and here you are living ...
B:	Huh-uh
A:	That just doesn't make too much sense.
B:	No.
B:	And I figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste, no matter who does it. and they have shown, some of the industries have been real good at, uh, uh, doing their part in, uh, reducing the amount that they have, *sd
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, they've reused some of it, uh,
B:	it can be recycled, a lot of their things,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and that they've shown, that it, uh, to begin with, apparently it does cost more,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	but, once they get started, it's really, it saves them money in the end,
B:	and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And if they would all,
B:	that's what, that's what we want done.
B:	Is, we want industry to take, you know, more responsibility in taking care of it.
A:	Well, um, individual companies and things are so selfish,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And their desires to save a few dollars and, and that
A:	they don't care about the environmental impact, that they make.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	they're greedy.
B:	It's money, is what is.
B:	It's, it's the money
A:	Yes.
B:	They're making fantastic amounts on these things
B:	and, uh, even the incinerator, the money and the income that they're going to make off this, is, you know, just astronomical.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Well, have you ever visited, um, like Los Angeles or any place that's ever, it's kind of known, that it has, uh, pollution in it's air?
B:	We've never been,
B:	we went as far as, as, uh, like Las Vegas, and Yellow Stone Park,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	We did go, we should have gone the whole way over,
B:	but we didn't.
B:	But, I understand that,
B:	we have an aunt that lives out there
B:	and, When she was visiting here, she would look up at the stars
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	She said they couldn't see those things out there, because of the smog and everything.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	That's so awful.
A:	Well, what about in New York.
A:	I guess you've gone that way, maybe.
B:	No.
B:	Never been in New York
B:	I don't want to go there
A:	Pretty funny.
B:	Have you been there?
A:	Well, I've been to New York.
A:	I have relatives that direction.
B:	Oh.
A:	We have,
A:	it's, um,
A:	is it close to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania?
B:	Um, no,
B:	I never heard of that one.
A:	Because I have family there
A:	and,
B:	We're near Pittsburgh, Clarion University.
A:	Oh, huh-uh.
A:	It's pretty neat.
B:	It's, it's kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania.
A:	That's beautiful country up that way.
A:	I know,
A:	it's, um, very lush and pretty, Up in the, back in the east.
A:	It's really,
B:	Are you a young person?
A:	Well, I'm thirty-one.
B:	Thirty-one.
B:	You're, you're young
A:	Seems kind of old to me.
B:	No,
B:	you're young.
B:	You have a lot of life yet,
B:	and, and these,
B:	we have some people who say, well, this isn't going to affect me, this air pollution,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	uh, older people,
B:	or they think they're far enough away from something, that it's,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody.
B:	And if you're older it's not going to affect you that way.
B:	You have grandchildren,
B:	you have children, uh,
A:	Yes.
B:	Nieces, nephews, whatever, friends.
B:	Uh, everybody is going to be affected by it.
A:	That's really true.
A:	And we all, you know, need to be willing to help pay a little bit. Like,
A:	I've heard some people, uh, grumble about their, uh, cars passing their emission tests, and things,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and how they've had to, how it's more expensive and things.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And I thought, well, it's so much better.
B:	They say it has really made a difference, though.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Now, see, we don't have that here, yet.
A:	Oh, you don't.
B:	No,
B:	we don't have that testing in that down here, yet.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But they,
B:	I have read that, that, that it has really helped where the problem is greater, where the population is greater,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and that it has made a difference.
A:	Well, I really think it must.
A:	I think every,
A:	I mean, well, think about how many automobiles there are.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And each is putting out,
A:	like we have a car,
A:	an older, one of our cars is an older car,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and every time you start it, from the tail pipe, it makes a black spot, on the cement,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And you know that, that is a sign.
B:	Something is coming out,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And that's, all cars are doing that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's really polluting the air.
B:	Yeah.
B:	If you have to put a price on it. Which is more valuable, life or paying a little more.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	And it's also, it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer,  and things,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	We sure wouldn't want, so much more people suffering from that.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And like I said, I think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it, because it's industry.
B:	We're paying industry to make the products
B:	and, we're helping pay for there making these end products that are, toxic waste.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Then, we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace,
B:	then they put it in the dump some place
B:	and they find out, well, this dump doesn't work
B:	so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else.
B:	We end up paying for it again.
B:	Now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted.
A:	Pretty sad.
B:	Or the,
B:	where they want to put, the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion, the two water sheds that feed Clarion river.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And, you know, it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there, because, if that water gets contaminated, it will go on down to Pittsburgh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It will, you know,
B:	it affects so many people.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this.
A:	No.
A:	No.
A:	It's scary
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	It's scary.
B:	It really is.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	It's really awful.
A:	Well, I've really enjoyed the conversation.
A:	It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more about
B:	It is really a concern. Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	And it's, instead of waiting until it directly affects me, like you say, it's important to be involved ahead of time.
A:	Well, you have a good day.
B:	Well, you, too.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I have got two.
B:	One is, uh, two
B:	and the other one's four
B:	and, uh, this is my first year of staying home.
B:	I've always had them in child care.
A:	Oh, well, then you are familiar with it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	I, uh, I have grandchildren
A:	and I know, uh, one has gone to a, well, two of them have gone to preschool.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.
A:	Why don't you tell me what you have found.
B:	Well, uh, the,
B:	with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with
B:	and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them
B:	and so I found another baby-sitter
B:	and she was wonderful
B:	except I thought that there were too many in the home
B:	and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care.
B:	She was wonderful,
B:	it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home.
B:	It was in home child care.
A:	Okay, Okay,
A:	so it was in home child care.
A:	You took them to someone's home?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, both times?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and then I worked in, in the child care centers
B:	and I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in
B:	so I just always had a fear about, you know, child care centers.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little
B:	and, and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill
B:	so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, uh, independent
B:	and, uh, I could go back to work.
A:	I know that in raising my children, uh, I was fortunate,
A:	I didn't have to work,
A:	we didn't necessarily have a lot of things
B:	Yeah
B:	That's how it's going now.
A:	But, uh, and, I know my daughter,
A:	because she has three
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean it's so expensive.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You have to really make a lot of money.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.
B:	Oh, no,
B:	yeah.
A:	You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known chain, uh, she was not at all happy with.
A:	It was, there was too many children per person.
A:	They were just kind of left to play,
A:	there was no structure to,
A:	and the middle grandson went there as a, uh, like a preschool thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of learning and training and stuff.
A:	Not just there, you know,
A:	so he went like, uh, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.
B:	Wow.
A:	And, uh, you know, and it was supposed to be a base,
A:	you know, starting to learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, you know, school and stuff,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, she was most unhappy with it.
B:	Huh.
A:	There was no structure,
A:	there was nothing to it.
A:	You know, and, uh, she pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent.
A:	It was, it was like a little kindergarten.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they had hot lunches
A:	and, and they had classes that, you know, one class they'd do art.
A:	They even familiarized the children with computers.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent one.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And how old was he?
A:	He's now five and a half.
A:	He's in kindergarten.
B:	Oh.
A:	This was last year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so, you know, it helped him and, and the first one, uh, he went to a, uh, church preschool that was very good.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The Methodist Church in Richardson.
B:	Oh.
A:	The big one
A:	and it was a excellent,
A:	they,
A:	very good.
B:	My little boy goes to the Methodist, uh, in Garland.
A:	Oh, does he?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm real happy with that one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, uh, the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run.
B:	Well, I've, I've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even the even the Mother's Day Out programs, I heard, are real good.
A:	Oh. I had, uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know experience there, that, you know, that they were good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I I didn't know that, uh, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm not that familiar.
A:	I just know that, you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm real happy with that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, Well, are you enjoying staying home?
B:	Well, that's a,
B:	Yes,
B:	I am
B:	Uh, I taught for Richardson School District
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I taught early childhood
B:	and I really enjoyed it,
B:	but it was just, it was taking a lot of my time
B:	and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them
B:	and it just seemed like they were sick more often
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just couldn't get the time off to,
B:	so,
A:	Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children. And have enthusiasm.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	It really is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really is.
B:	And I felt,
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	could you tell me what you think contributes most to, uh, air pollution?
B:	Well, it's hard to say.
B:	I mean, while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.
B:	What do you think?
A:	Um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos.
A:	I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put into the atmosphere.
A:	I think probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, uh, do you live right in the city itself?
B:	No,
B:	I'm more out in the suburbs,
B:	but I certainly work near a city.
A:	Okay,
A:	so Can you notice,
B:	How about you?
A:	well it's, it's,
A:	I live in a rural area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's mainly farms and, uh, no heavy industry.
A:	Attleboro, itself,
A:	I live in Rhode Island.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, it's in the north,
A:	I live up in the, uh, northeast corner
A:	and Attleboro sits in just over the line, where T I's plant is,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but there isn't a lot of heavy industry.
A:	There's the freeways
A:	and we get an occasional,
A:	it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston, cause we're like forty miles south of Boston,
A:	so we'll pick up that.
A:	And, uh, I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,
A:	we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
A:	and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger,
A:	they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over, over our homes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, it seems like, uh, we're catching all that residue.
A:	I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping.
A:	But, other than that, you know, we don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions. You know from the power plants. Um.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You mean like from the coal.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	we generate,
A:	one of our, our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to, uh, generate electricity.
B:	Um,
A:	Um, there doesn't seem to be much emission from them,
A:	but I'm not sure about the rest of the country.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I notice locally a major problem is Kodak.
B:	Um, it's interesting
B:	because in order to, uh, keep with the E P A standards which, which tend to be visible, uh, what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions at night.
B:	Uh, so people get up,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
B:	and they've got this black ash on their cars, which, you know, seems to be,
A:	Yeah,
A:	surprise, surprise.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	There, there must be, uh, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, larger plants up, uh, up around one hundred twenty-eight.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, we've got reports that, uh,
A:	during the night seems like they'd blow off their, their stacks from, uh, the warehouses, for powerhouses,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, they do that at night too, because, employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, you know, spots all over them.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, you're right,
A:	they could do something about, about that, I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That seems a little ridiculous.
A:	How are your, uh, your lakes,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Oh they've been getting cleaner.
A:	They have?
B:	Sure.
B:	But, um, yeah,
B:	I'm not sure how much the water pollution is, is directly related to the air pollution, other than acid rain,
B:	yeah,
A:	Acid rain,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that's what I was, uh,
B:	I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, uh, overstated. That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.
B:	Um,
B:	I'm not an expert.
A:	Yeah,
A:	no.
A:	Didn't they just have an article, oh, on, uh,
A:	they were dumping lime.
B:	Up here?
A:	Up, upstate New York somewhere, over huge areas,
B:	I haven't read that.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	and they thought that was more beneficial because, you know it, it, some of it does soak in
A:	and some of it runs off right away into the, in to the streams and rivers
A:	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can't remember where
A:	I, I read that recently somewhere,
A:	and I can't remember where.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's
A:	But I, I thought it was up there.
A:	So, that's interesting because New Hampshire, and parts of Vermont, um, they showed pictures of, of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, you kind of think it's something else then?
B:	Well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article.
B:	So that,
A:	Oh, they didn't say, they didn't say what though,
A:	they just said they thought it was,
B:	They didn't say what,
B:	they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected. Um, that it may be other natural things at work. Um,
A:	Uh, natural disease,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so it's, it's less than clear.
B:	Like I said, I don't remember the article that well.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, um, I don't know,
B:	I mean, what do you think we can, uh, I guess as individuals or as a group, do about, uh, air pollution?
A:	Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing.
A:	I still think that's, that's, uh, one of our major causes of pollutants.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult.
B:	I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for, for less pollutant vehicles.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you I think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, where, uh, or, uh, uh, A A R P, which has a lot of members. Uh, if you can get those types of groups.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.
B:	I mean, I remember reading an article that said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,
B:	the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent, of the automobile pollution
A:	Yeah,
B:	and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're better,
A:	but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there.
A:	Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.
A:	Uh, I'm not really sure.
A:	You think that, that, that the, uh, the trucking industry is that, uh, incompetent, that they wouldn't, you know,
A:	fuel is, is one of their biggest costs.
B:	Right.
A:	So, you would,
B:	But diesel engines.
A:	Yeah,
A:	diesel engines.
B:	It, you know, it's, it,
B:	I mean, they do generate a lot of soot
B:	but that at least, that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid transit systems.
A:	This country seems to be a little behind on that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car, driving.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	A lot of people don't even like to carpool.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But we could that.
A:	That'll help, pollution, air pollution,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The, uh, United States and Canada are I guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements to limit, uh, what's being given out by power plants,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,
B:	Yeah,
B:	sure.
A:	So that's helping.
B:	Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe
B:	and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted?
A:	Now that's an idea.
A:	don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,
B:	Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax
B:	or you just buy one of these things
B:	and it, it, uh,
B:	maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
B:	and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
B:	and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
B:	and you couldn't start your car anymore.
A:	That's a, that's an interesting concept.
A:	Is that your idea?
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, uh, you know, it's, uh,
B:	I guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
B:	so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something.
A:	Well I was going to say,
A:	right.
A:	You could put it in, you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean I guess you could take those off too
A:	but,
B:	You could take
B:	but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if you can take a muffler off and only replace,
A:	well not unless it was built into every muffler.
B:	Right.
A:	And that's .
B:	But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,
A:	That's a, that's quite a concept.
A:	You should, uh, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	patent it,
B:	that's a good idea.
A:	If you could come up with a device that's the thing.
B:	Right.
A:	But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that.
A:	But that's a, that's a thought.
A:	No,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you're right
A:	and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems.
A:	I don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, I guess the proper authorities,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well you might, uh, generate some
B:	Yeah,
B:	the automobile regulatory agencies or something.
A:	yeah,
A:	you might generate some interest in it.
A:	But that's, that's a good idea.
A:	Other than that I'm not sure what, what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What are your music interests?
A:	Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock
A:	I, I don't care, for acid rock,
B:	Me, too.
B:	Oh.
A:	but, uh, I grew up with country and western,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did, too,
A:	but, uh,
B:	and then,
A:	just about any kind of music.
A:	I even like classical music.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I'm pretty diversified, too.
B:	I, I don't, I don't like acid rock either.
B:	I, I grew up in a small town
B:	so, uh, the only, we only had one radio station
B:	so it was country music,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but then, uh, when I,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	You're older than I am
A:	But, uh, I,
A:	did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?
B:	We don't get Channel Two.
B:	My, uh, our cable doesn't,
A:	Oh.
B:	I wish we got that what,
B:	but,
A:	That is fabulous.
B:	Was it?
B:	Well, we don't get Channel Two.
A:	We,
A:	Yeah,
A:	when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, it was tremendous.
B:	Now, he, he is a, uh,
B:	actually, I did,
B:	I played flute for, almost ten years
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, uh, so, I, I, I appreciate his too, his, his
A:	Yeah.
B:	he, he, he's from Ireland isn't he?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	and it was, uh, mostly all Irish tunes,
B:	Was
B:	yeah.
A:	they had a band with him that, uh, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, uh, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, uh, drum,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth,
A:	it was just fabulous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, he, he is really good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I come from a musical background,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, uh, uh, I've played flute, flute and piano,
B:	so, I, I, I have a big appreciation for music, up to a point.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming and much of the new stuff that's coming out,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	my husband says I'm getting old
A:	Yeah
A:	I love, uh, I, I especially like instrumentals.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I love to just lay back on the couch and, and turn a good, good instrumental got on and just close my eyes and listen.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's nice to do, that is.
B:	I've got a, I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting,
B:	I'm getting well versed in, in kiddy music
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I've never played an instrument in my life,
A:	I've always wanted too,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,
B:	Yeah
A:	but, uh,
B:	I was one of the forced ones
A:	but I, I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
B:	Oh, I could never do that
A:	and,
B:	I was never that brave
B:	but, uh, yeah.
A:	I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, yeah,
B:	I've, I've done, I've done that at church too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I haven't done that in a long time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, let's see
B:	what .
B:	Well, what kind of music do you not like?
A:	Well, like I say the acid rock,
A:	I just do not
A:	an I don't care for rap music either.
B:	Oh,
B:	that's not music
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	no.
B:	that is not,
B:	I don't know what that is,
B:	but that's not music
A:	If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.
B:	Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,
B:	it's just, it's just, uh, uh, talking in a beat,
B:	it is just, it's not exciting at all
A:	Yeah.
B:	it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you can't dance to it,
B:	you can't do anything to it
A:	Right.
A:	But, I, and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Have you ever been to the, to, to the Dallas Symphony?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have you?
B:	Is
B:	are, are they good?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're good.
B:	Are they?
B:	I, I have, I have, never been.
A:	And, uh, we went and saw, uh, LES MISERABLES
B:	Oh, really?
A:	oh, the music in that was fantastic.
B:	I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I heard that was hard to get tickets to.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it, uh,
A:	I can't remember how far in advance we reserved, tickets
A:	but it was out, you know, out at the State Fair Music Hall
A:	and, uh it was well worth the price.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was a real,
B:	Was it?
A:	Yeah,
B:	I, I bet it was,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I really bet it was
B:	Is that the only, uh, musical,
B:	do you go see a lot of musicals?
A:	Just, just ever so often you know, a real, a real good one like that one
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	That, that would be, that would be nice
A:	I went and saw, uh, I think it was, uh, SUGAR BABIES,
A:	that was good,
A:	that had good music in it.
B:	Was it?
B:	How, how,
B:	I can't, I don't know what that's about.
A:	Uh, that was the one with Mickey Rooney
A:	and, uh, oh, what's that real, oh, not real old, my wife she is old too, dancer, uh,
A:	I can't think of her name.
A:	I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something.
B:	Uh, uh, uh, I think I know who you're oh, I know who you're talking about,
A:	real long legs, and dark hair.
B:	she's got black hair,
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay,
B:	I know who your talking about.
B:	I can't think ever her name either.
A:	I can't think of it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that that was, that was,
B:	I remember that being, uh, here a few years ago.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh,
B:	Oh, oh, the last country music,
B:	my, my parents still, uh, really like country, music
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they, they like, uh, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	and, and, uh, well, my, my, my, my parents,
A:	The Blackwoods.
B:	yeah,
B:	my husband likes, uh, country music real well
B:	and he, he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, yeah,
B:	he really likes Shenandoah.
A:	Alabama.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, yeah,
B:	Alabama,
A:	Uh,
B:	I think, I think they're a bit over exposed
A:	Yeah
B:	I get kind, of get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.
A:	Yeah,
A:	either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.
B:	Oh, I, I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior.
A:	I never have either,
A:	and I never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row.
B:	Oh
B:	Oh, we, we watch those award shows too,
B:	we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff
B:	but I just, I just don't care for him,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just never have.
B:	I don't,
A:	I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably Eddy Arnold.
B:	Is, is it?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	I, I think, I, I know who that is,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I think my parents have have, uh, some of his records.
A:	But, uh, I got a, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, uh, some, uh, I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western, songs,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him him.
B:	I've heard the name.
A:	He was, uh, played in the old western movies.
A:	He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe
B:	Huh.
A:	or they,
A:	I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy
A:	and,
B:	I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,
A:	had a real raspy voice,
B:	Huh.
A:	and, uh,
B:	No,
B:	I never have
A:	some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	those go back quite a way
A:	Yeah.
A:	I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, my mother and dad use to, uh, own a restaurant,
B:	It's hard to,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and he had, uh, they had a, uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy would give her the old records
B:	Well, that
B:	that's neat.
A:	so, that's where I got my,
B:	that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records.
B:	Is there not?
B:	You, you'd, well you'd think there would be.
A:	Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle
B:	Well, that's true.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, uh, they, just won't play on a modern day, uh phonograph.
B:	Well, that's a shame
B:	because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot
B:	and you see seventy-eights, a, a lot at, at the stores, at record stores,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you'd, think there'd be a market for,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them
B:	but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound.
B:	No.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, those things were big and thick weren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	You could kill somebody with them
A:	Yeah,
A:	warped real easy.
B:	And the ones you buy,
B:	go out and buy one now
B:	and they're just so thin and, flimsy
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they just, they're not meant to last, at all,
A:	Yeah.
B:	neither are tapes.
B:	I, I we buy cassette tapes,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and machines will eat them,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so, the best bet, any, these days are compact disk,
B:	those things are practically indestructible
A:	But, I, I guess, you know, the old country and western music you,
A:	back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,
B:	Oh, no.
A:	so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio,
B:	Radio.
A:	and, uh,
B:	that's just what, just what you had,
B:	plus,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think it was better back then to,
B:	there's too much T V now
A:	Yeah.
B:	and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than, than television,
A:	Yeah.
B:	your imagination
A:	Yeah.
B:	kept
B:	and
B:	it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does
A:	Yeah,
A:	I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Was it on the radio every week?
A:	Yeah.
B:	what day, what day was that on,
B:	do you, can you recall.
A:	Uh, uh, seems like it was on a Friday,
B:	Uh.
A:	Friday or,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?
B:	Do you think it's a
A:	Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.
A:	I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
A:	I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
A:	and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
A:	and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
B:	That's true.
A:	and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think it teaches kids how to grow.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Uh, I agree with you.
B:	Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of,
B:	you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts
B:	and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,
B:	but these days they're not, uh,
B:	parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.
B:	Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part of, of the scouting, and, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've, I've,
A:	that's really great.
A:	I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.
B:	They are
B:	but parents,
A:	You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they do.
A:	and they don't follow it at all, you know.
A:	There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals
A:	but,
B:	I, I, uh,
B:	senior.
A:	Oh.
A:	Senior,
A:	okay.
A:	So, there's not, uh,
B:	Oh, they're just not,
B:	once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they lose interest.
A:	and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're more for, I
B:	Me
A:	Not, not,
A:	yeah.
B:	Grab,
B:	grab,
B:	grab,
B:	walk out
A:	Yeah,
A:	you're absolutely right
B:	Yeah
A:	I think it's a really a good thing.
A:	I, I like to see,
A:	of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help
B:	Yeah,
B:	but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.
A:	But I think, we ought to start right here at home.
A:	I'm, you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people.
A:	No,
A:	it, it,
B:	But, since there is much that needs to be done here.
A:	I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here
A:	and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it's been really good.
A:	We talked about this for a few minutes,
A:	and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,
A:	but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.
B:	No,
B:	I, I agree with you
A:	It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well you take care,
A:	and, and, enjoy the day.
B:	You, too.
B:	You, too.
A:	Thank you, ma'am.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Do are you on a regular exercise program right now?
B:	Yes,
B:	and I hate it
B:	How about you?
A:	Oh, well, I'm kind of off and on.
B:	Off and on
B:	well, I guess I've been kind of off and on
B:	I've, uh, Had some health problems that have led me to, uh,
A:	Right now I'm kind of off.
B:	I'd say more on than off
A:	Okay,
A:	what type of exercise do you do?
B:	Uh, I do walking on the treadmill,
B:	and then I do low impact aerobics.
A:	Okay.
A:	I guess you don't enjoy that very much.
B:	Not, not really.
A:	Do you find that, uh, to be boring?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and time consuming,
B:	I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,
B:	it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,
B:	then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But I,
B:	Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year
A:	Yeah,
A:	I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not
A:	I just bought myself a solo flex machine,
A:	I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.
A:	But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,
A:	so it's collecting dust right now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot of things do that.
B:	I had an, I had an exercise bike
A:	I used to jog somewhat.
B:	I use to have one,
B:	and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,
B:	but I do use my treadmill
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, that's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my parents have a treadmill
A:	it's,
A:	when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I just got the bicycle out today,
A:	and it was real nice outside,
A:	had to get out to do something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can't ride a bike
B:	so.
A:	I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
A:	so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's too nice,
B:	it's been too nice all weekend.
A:	But, uh, yeah,
A:	I need to start jog something again.
A:	I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,
A:	but it's terribly boring,
A:	and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.
B:	Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?
A:	No,
A:	I never have.
A:	Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries
A:	I usually only go about a mile or two.
B:	I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's not quite so so easy.
A:	You have to have the right, type of shoes too,
A:	that's, very important.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .
A:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
A:	my don't get very much use
B:	Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I usually enjoy the exercise I do
A:	but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.
A:	So I'll, I'll bicycle
A:	I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,
A:	but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.
A:	But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,
A:	I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, don't let it collect dust.
B:	At least exercise while dusting it off
A:	Yeah.
B:	well.
A:	Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that'll be good.
A:	I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,
A:	an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.
B:	Oh.
A:	And that was very helpful
A:	we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I found that to be, uh, very helpful.
B:	Are you going to do that?
A:	Uh, I need to,
A:	I haven't started yet
A:	but, uh, it's a thought.
B:	Well, that sounds like something good to do then.
A:	Sounds like something I should do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.
A:	How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?
B:	Well, I do,
B:	I switch every other day
B:	one day I walk
B:	and one day I do the aerobics.
A:	Okay,
A:	how far, about how far do you go walking?
B:	Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now
B:	I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,
B:	and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,
A:	Okay.
B:	but I'm trying to workup to three miles.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.
B:	Yeah,
A:	It,
B:	it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.
A:	Sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but.
A:	Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,
B:	My walkman broke,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I'm upset
B:	and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud
A:	Yeah.
A:	But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is
B:	and this doesn't, you know,
B:	my treadmill has an incline
B:	and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it.
A:	Um, do you go to an aerobics class
A:	or do you watch, on T V?
B:	No,
B:	I, I just do it on T V,
A:	Okay.
B:	I have a cassette.
A:	Which, uh, shows do you watch on T V?
B:	Um, it's a, it's a
B:	I use tapes.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	okay,
A:	like a Cathy Smith workout,
B:	Or, or Richard Simmons,
A:	or Jane Fonda.
A:	Okay
B:	Sweating to the oldies
A:	Right.
A:	I, every now and then I'll watch E S P N,
A:	I get cable on T V,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they have, uh, a couple of shows called basic training,
A:	and, uh, what is the other one called.
B:	There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,
B:	I don't know if he's still on any more or not,
B:	I I don't know if I get E S P N or not
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, one, you know,
B:	I use to watch one, watch one on the air,
B:	but that was back,
A:	BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill.
B:	That's was,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I watched that cause he was cute
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's not bad
A:	his assistants usually aren't either.
B:	But, uh,
A:	They're always in, in Hawaii some place. On, on the beach.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	But then that was back when, uh, you know, the high impact and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they, they do low I pact stuff now,
B:	Do they.
B:	Are
B:	yeah
B:	they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	every morning.
B:	I'll have to tune in.
A:	It's on E S P N, uh,
A:	at what time,
A:	I can't remember what time.
A:	It's, uh, you know,
A:	I can't remember offhand what time.
B:	I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up,
A:	Yeah
B:	and, but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on
A:	Yeah,
A:	every now and then.
B:	Not everybody has a picture perfect body.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.
B:	I haven't watch any other ones on T V. watch=watched Just on some of the tapes.
A:	They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.
B:	Okay,
B:	thanks.
A:	but, uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made.
B:	Now, that's a thought.
A:	So I'm kind of bad about that myself.
B:	Well, that's thought,
B:	I haven't thought about that,
B:	well they're going to beep us pretty soon.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness.
B:	Nice talking to you too.
B:	Okay,
B:	thanks.
A:	So, all right.
B:	Talk to you later.
A:	Good night.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening.
A:	Uh, I'm against it
A:	but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that
A:	So I, I have a rifle in the house.
A:	Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it.
A:	But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon.
A:	Uh, how do you feel about it?
B:	Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, I think they need that.
B:	Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol.
B:	It's a little twenty-two
B:	and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, I do like to have my guns.
B:	Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know.
B:	And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old
B:	Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I like to have them where handy.
A:	Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition.
A:	And I thought that was really good.
A:	And I think if they, uh,
A:	takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition.
A:	You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.
B:	I've never heard of anything like that.
A:	Yeah. Uh,
B:	That would be nice.
B:	But,  you know,
B:	the criminals that are going to get their guns one  way or the other.
A:	I  I, I agree.
A:	I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.
A:	But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.
B:	Yeah
A:	And you can get them really cheap.
B:	I know
B:	I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee. And, uh, they had a waiting period
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we bought it there.
B:	And,
A:	How long was the waiting period out there?
B:	About nine days.
A:	Huh.
A:	That wasn't too, too bad.
B:	No.
B:	No
A:	Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it.
A:	You're not going to react that quickly.
A:	In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.
B:	somebody wants to do that,
B:	I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose.
A:	They both do the same kind of job.
B:	A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	I suppose.
A:	I never got shot with either one.
A:	But I don't know, uh,
A:	I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
B:	No,
B:	a shotgun's got too much of a spread.
B:	Or at  least ours does.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it's, you know,
B:	you have a little, uh, thing on the bottom of on top of the barrel where you, you turn it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.
A:	Oh.
B:	And the spread changes.
A:	Uh, I've got a manual single shot
A:	and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it.
A:	The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets from the target.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets.
A:	It's got a hell of a kick to it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time.
B:	And I shot that thing one time.
B:	Almost knocked me down.
B:	And it just a
B:	I I forget,
B:	I think it was a three fifty-seven.
B:	I'm not sure.
A:	Do you belong to a gun club or you?
B:	He belonged to one awhile back.
B:	Uh, since we moved,
B:	we've only been here in Texas for about a year
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for  target practice.
A:	No kidding.
B:	I'd love to get used to that shotgun.
B:	We traded his pistol for that shotgun.
A:	Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive
A:	but, uh, it's well worth it.
A:	You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.
A:	Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire.
A:	Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high.
A:	Plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member.
A:	So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.
A:	Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's what my husband,
B:	when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it's a cough or something was
B:	It, you know,
B:	he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.
A:	I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.
A:	In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.
B:	That's a good,
B:	I've never thought of that.
B:	That's a good point.
A:	And, you know, it, it,
A:	even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive.
A:	And you give him a license because he waited nine days.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's,
B:	and, yeah.
A:	He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself.
A:	He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.
B:	It,
B:	well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in Memphis
B:	and, uh, this one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something.
B:	And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot.
A:	Wow.
A:	He was fortunate.
A:	He could, he could of hit something else
B:	Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh, shooting his foot almost off.
B:	He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure, being,  Mister Cowboy.
A:	Wow.
B:	I can't remember what the the term was going around.
B:	It was about four or five years ago.
B:	But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea
A:	About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons?
A:	Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me.
A:	How do you feel about that?
A:	Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller?
A:	And, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh, because you own it?
B:	Uh, that's a hard one because we did that.
B:	But, uh, I think there ought to be some rule against it.
B:	I'll, uh, you know,
B:	the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.
A:	Yeah.
A:	isn't  there a way to, uh, to deregister yourself after you register a gun?
B:	Uh,
B:	I have no idea.
B:	I've only  had one gun
A:	Because I   have,
B:	and I've kept it, you  know, the one gun that was in my name.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Is it registered?
B:	Yeah.
A:	The, uh, the rifle that I've got is not registered,
A:	and, uh, I don't know why I never registered it
A:	but the, uh,
B:	I don't think you have to register a shotgun
A:	Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary
A:	The, uh, the,
B:	Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.
B:	If they go to, uh, regulating, uh, all right, uh, banning guns. private citizens
A:	Yeah.
B:	this,
B:	my kid is jumping on me.
B:	I can't hardly talk.
B:	My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess that could happen.
A:	It's just like the, uh, the social security system
A:	Once they, uh, they gave everybody a number
A:	and now they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth.
A:	And  once they have your number, they have your identification.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And everything about you.
A:	And , that's true
B:	Uh, I,
B:	you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh,
B:	my kid is banging.
B:	I was seeing what they was banging on.
B:	Uh, I've lost my train of thought.
B:	I'm sorry
A:	That's all right.
A:	You, you were talking about, uh, uh, what the Federal government knows about people.
B:	Oh, the
B:	Yeah.
B:	They, they probably know everything from, half the time what time you go to the bathroom.
A:	They probably do.
B:	No,
B:	that's that's a little bit extreme.
B:	But they could know anything and everything about you.
B:	And, uh, I'd like to have my gun.
B:	If they go to banding, banning them, I'd lose my gun
B:	but we wouldn't lose our our, uh, shotgun.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I don't, I don't, uh
A:	Do you find it difficult picking up, uh, guns that, that are not registered?
B:	No.
A:	No.
A:	I don't either.
A:	I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to.
A:	Just  you know, put up the money.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you can look in the, uh, the,
B:	we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a, a it's a, it's a bargain thing.
B:	Uh, you go and you know, always see guns in there. Five to seven guns a day.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It comes out every Tuesday.
A:	And there's, there's no waiting period on that.
B:	No.
B:	None whatsoever
B:	You call,
B:	we sold a refrigerator through it
B:	and it took us all of twelve hours.
A:	To sell the refrigerator?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.
A:	Huh. And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control.
A:	I, I don't believe in, uh,
A:	I'm I shouldn't probably say control.
A:	I mean regulation.
A:	Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have.
A:	Uh, but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I agree with you there.
B:	They do have too much control over us already.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.
A:	Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money,
A:	so I can't complain too much.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess so.
B:	I don't know.
B:	They're
A:	Well, I haven't heard anything about the proposal myself,
A:	but, uh, Uh, I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around.
B:	No,
B:	I haven't either.
A:	I've, I've always felt for a long time that I, I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, uh, primarily in the military.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	Most countries require that now,
B:	they you know, they have, uh, it mandatory for, for the, the uh at least the young men,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know about the young women,
B:	I don't know if they have to serve in the military,  too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a lot,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, you take Israel
A:	I mean, everybody does.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't think it's a bad idea,
A:	teaches, teaches a lot.
A:	I mean, I went in the service when I was eighteen, And, uh, stayed in for ten years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, did a lot of growing up.
B:	I bet.
B:	You have to.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my father had been in the military.
B:	I didn't do it myself.
B:	My father had
B:	and that's, uh, how he put himself through school basically.
A:	Yeah.
B:	He came from a poor immigrant family,
B:	and he didn't have a chance to, uh, you know,
B:	the family wasn't wealthy,
B:	so he had to do something to,  put himself through school,
A:	Do it himself.
B:	and he did.
B:	And he was very successful.
A:	Well, my parents wanted to send me to college,
A:	and I was dead set against it
A:	You know, I had wanderlust, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I got in,
A:	and after, after wasting the first six years, partying and everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something.
A:	So I started to work on my education.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Course my job was such that I didn't, I couldn't do it as much as I wanted
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree.
B:	That's pretty good.
A:	But, I've been in school ever since
B:	That's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, uh,
B:	I don't know.
B:	There's other kinds of service to the country that could be done, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean if you don't like,
B:	I mean, working in the national parks, Uh, working, clean up the roadsides
A:	Sure.
A:	Exactly.
B:	I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time, *why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, to go out and clean up the roads. You know,
A:	Oh yeah, Absolutely.
B:	I mean,
A:	All these, all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients,
A:	and if they're able-bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks  places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we'd learn service to other people   in this country.
A:	Sure ,
A:	sure.
A:	So I'm,
A:	get something out of that money.
B:	Country would benefit,
A:	Yeah
A:	I've,
B:	I mean, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	my next door neighbor when I was growing up, worked for the unemployment division,
A:	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
A:	and,
B:	That right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and he, he had all kinds of horror stories.
A:	You know, these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks,
A:	and, back, back in those days they also use to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this
B:	Yeah.
A:	They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm, I I have a hard time dealing with that.
B:	What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I was astounded.
B:	I don't even make that.
A:	No,
A:	I know.
A:	I, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and somebody's taking that away.
A:	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no doubt.
A:	You know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous,
A:	and now, I, I, I, uh, started out when I first got in graduate school
A:	I was going into public administration,
A:	and, uh, quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more.
B:	Is that right,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You sit there
A:	and when you're writing up budgets, you wonder, okay, how much money do we need.
A:	Well, you need X number dollars for the recipients
A:	but you need X number dollars to administer the program.
A:	Well just ridiculous.
B:	Yeah.
A:	This is ridiculous.
B:	It's sad.
A:	It is,
A:	it's pathetic.
A:	I mean, there's got to be a different way.
A:	There's got to be a better way.
A:	But it'll never happen.
A:	I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What would happen if the required young people to do service to the country,
B:	what should they get in return, I wonder.
B:	Like, uh,
A:	I think, I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh,
A:	and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Give an incentive.
B:	Educational or vocational training or something.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Something that's going to help them along the way.
B:	And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people,
A:	Sure,
A:	I mean,
A:	Well, this,
A:	I mean I mean, look at the statistics,
B:	and that's only going to help.
A:	I mean, it's sad.
A:	One in five Americans can't read
B:	Yeah.
A:	adults, that is, can't even read.
A:	And, and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, what are we, what are we becoming?
A:	We're becoming a service country.
B:	As opposed to what we were twenty years ago.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we were an industrial giant,
A:	and now we're we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game.
A:	We taught them how to do it,
A:	and they, they did it better than we do.
B:	Yeah
A:	Simple as that.
B:	because they have the ambition, I guess.
A:	yeah,
A:	simple as that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	which is good for them,
B:	but on the other hand, we kind of lose out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's terrible for us.
B:	I think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, and it can be good for them, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh yeah.
A:	I mean, even, even the greedy kids that we've got now ...
B:	Oh god, you go to the mall
B:	and you see, you know, fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night, you know
A:	I know.
B:	for what.
A:	I know.
B:	Give me the money
B:	and I'll, I'll teach them something good
A:	Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, that's my other complaint.
A:	Parents aren't parents any more.
B:	No.
B:	They've, they've relinquished their parenting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I, I can say yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, I talked with somebody else about that another time,
B:	and, you know, when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, I was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program.
B:	And I just love teaching.
B:	That was a lot, that's probably the most fun I had.
B:	And, uh, it helped me out because I learned things and learned how to do things differently.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And when, uh, when come time to get out of school, I thought, Boy, I'd like to teach.
B:	But you know, for, for what.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life.
A:	Exactly.
B:	I mean, that, that's a sad thing to think,
B:	and that's kind of selfish on my part,
B:	and I admit that,
A:	Well, in a way it is,
A:	but you have to look out for yourself you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	I mean, that's
A:	and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers,
B:	That's wrong.
A:	Yeah,
A:	gosh,
A:	I mean,
B:	I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less,
B:	I saying teachers should be paid more.
A:	No,
A:	I mean yeah.
A:	They do an absolutely necessary job,
A:	I mean, I, I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I mean, there's, there's a sense of priorities here, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, we need,
A:	what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids.
B:	Yeah
B:	They both have their place.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they,
A:	sure.
B:	But, you know, when it gets right down to it,
A:	I mean, one's
A:	I mean, on the other hand, I mean, you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars.
B:	That's pretty good.
A:	Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, my other pet peeve is unions.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh yeah.
A:	You know, it's just, it's, it's ridiculous the way unions have gone.
A:	There was a time when unions were needed.
B:	And they served a good function.
A:	And they served a good function,
A:	but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated,
A:	and they're only there to perpetuate their own, their own power structure.
B:	I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management.
B:	It was a steel manufacturing place,
B:	and they, uh,
B:	this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap,
B:	and they were having a hard time.
B:	And they told the strikers there, look,
B:	we need you to come back and get this stuff done.
B:	Or else we're going to be out of business.
B:	And they wouldn't come back,
B:	so they went bankrupt.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and they all lost their jobs.
A:	Sure,
A:	and, and   and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country.
B:	And it's like , you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So many times, I mean, you had the, uh, the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time.
A:	And, well, that took care of that industry
B:	That's right.
A:	and, and, then, and I'll tell you,
A:	Detroit worked awfully hard on, on stopping car manufacturing in this country.
B:	And they're trying to do that now with the imports.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, you know, we've never caught up,
A:	and I don't think we ever will.
B:	It'll be a tough road, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, here it is,
A:	and we've got, we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know And they only did it because they, I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's about right.
A:	Gosh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, back to the original subject,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service,
A:	I don't care what kind it is.
B:	It teaches them pride in their country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and pride in themselves, too.
B:	That's right.
A:	They could, they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing.
B:	Yeah,
A:	I mean,
B:	that's right.
B:	That's like Eagle Scouts.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's a great idea.
A:	I think they ought to take them and, I don't know, just have sort of like a, a, a manpower pool and say Okay, look,
A:	we need somebody ...
A:	Okay,
A:	we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it.
B:	Okay.
B:	Fantastic.
B:	Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's amazing, uh,
A:	I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing, uh.
B:	Right.
A:	When I was in college I, I enjoyed teaching,
A:	'cause I did some teaching part-time
A:	and I really enjoyed that
A:	but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high,
A:	it just, you know, all the problems.
B:	Oh, Lord, I mean, yeah,
B:	an, you talk about stress and pressure,
B:	I tell you what,
B:	it's, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week,
A:	I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.
B:	Do,
B:	right.
A:	And, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid.
B:	Exactly,
B:	and,
A:	And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know.
B:	That's right,
B:	and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I
B:	what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.
B:	You know, it's, uh,
B:	I just don't understand that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, uh.
A:	Now do you have little kids, or what?
B:	No, uh,
B:	sure don't,
B:	my wife and I've just been married about two years
B:	but I have a sister that's a, uh, school teacher,
B:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	my wife and I have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old.
B:	Okay.
A:	So we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year. Not, not, well not this coming fall but the year after that.
B:	Okay,
B:	so it's getting close.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's going to be going to kindergarten,
A:	so.
B:	Right.
A:	So, you know, we're, we're thinking about that.
A:	What's that going to be like.
A:	Are they going to be taught nothing,
A:	or they going be taught something,
A:	we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education.
A:	We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, uh, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know,
B:	Exactly.
B:	Right,
B:	that's true.
A:	and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or understand some science. You know,
B:	Exactly.
A:	I mean give me a break,
A:	that's, that's, that's bogus.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Well and, uh, you know, one thing my wife and I've talked about, are, uh, private schools. You know whether, uh, uh, we would want to invest in, in private schools as they're growing up, because, you know, just in the Dallas area, um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And Dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling.
B:	Right.
A:	I couldn't believe that.
B:	Right.
B:	You know, one, that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano.
B:	We were hoping, you know, well the school district's going to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding.
A:	I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way
A:	but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.
A:	That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit.
B:	That's,
B:	yeah,
B:	and, you know, that's,
B:	taxes right now are political suicide. You know,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and I don't think any politician's going to do that,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know,
A:	if it works at colleges it will work down below.
B:	Right.
A:	And, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do.
A:	But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more.
B:	Exactly.
B:	And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, I think. Because, uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, uh,
A:	And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything,
A:	I mean, good grief what's .
B:	Yeah
B:	now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, you know.
A:	I can't believe that.
A:	I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened.
A:	You never heard about that.
B:	Well yeah,
B:	we didn't, we didn't even think about it, you know
A:	No.
A:	And now, you know, what do we have now.
A:	You know, got kids that, either got a, you know, a Magnum gun school,
A:	like good grief.
B:	right.
A:	I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, I mean teaching, or even being a student
A:	and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school.
A:	What's going to happen?
A:	I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go.
B:	Exactly,
B:	right.
A:	But there again , you can't hold them back.
B:	Another reason,
B:	and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,
B:	but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school,
A:	and that was,
A:	well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine,
A:	so.
B:	Okay.
A:	That was what, twelve years ago, I guess.
B:	Right.
A:	So, you know, it's lot different now.
A:	And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, uh, oldest son is in high school.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to even think about it.
B:	That, yeah, that is a scary thought,
B:	but, uh, I don't know,
B:	I, I guess what you have to do is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try to be open with them, so that you can deal with the problems as they come up.
A:	That's all you can do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and.
A:	You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,
B:	Right.
A:	still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents. You know,
B:	Exactly.
A:	an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape.
B:	That's right.
A:	And, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know,
A:	the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera.
A:	They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad.
A:	I, maybe I'm wrong, because I haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,
